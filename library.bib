abstract = {This study investigates the fate and behavior of lead (Pb), copper (Cu), antimony (Sb), and arsenic (As) in a shooting range soil. The soil samples were collected from the surface (0-15 cm) and the subsurface (15-40 cm and 40-55 cm) of a grassy and wood chip covered impact area behind a firing position. Optical microscopy images indicate significant amounts of corroded bullet fragments and organic wood chips in the surface soil. Analysis by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and scanning electron microscopy electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) showed that metallic Pb was transformed into lead oxides (litharge PbO and massicot PbO) and lead carbonates (hydrocerussite Pb3 (CO3)2(OH)2, cerussite PbCO3, and plumbonacrite Pb5(CO3)3O (OH)2). Rietveld quantification indicated the surface soil contained 14.1{\%} metallic Pb, 17.9{\%} hydrocerussite, 5.2{\%} plumbonacrite, 5.9{\%} litharge, and 3.9{\%} massicot on a dry weight basis, or a total of 39.7{\%} Pb, far in excess of lead concentrations typically found in US shooting range soils. Metallic Cu (bullet jacket material) appeared stable as no secondary minerals were detected in the surface soil. As and Sb concentrations were on the order of 1,057 mg/kg and 845 mg/kg respectively. The elevated soil pH coupled with high organic carbon content is thought to have caused downward migration of metals, especially for Pb, since 4,153 mg Pb/kg was observed at a depth of 55 cm. More than 60{\%} of Pb was concentrated in the coarse soil ({\textgreater} 0.425 mm) fraction, suggesting soil clean-up possible by physical soil washing may be viable. The concentrations of Pb, As, and Sb in the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) extracts were 8,869 mg/L, 6.72 mg/L, and 6.42 mg/L respectively, were above the USEPA non-hazardous regulatory limit (As and Pb) of 5 mg/L. The elevated Sb and As concentrations draw concern because there is historically limited information concerning these metals at firing ranges and several values exceeded local soil cleanup criteria. As the high Pb concentrations appeared to be linked to the presence of organic-rich berm cover materials, the use of wood chips as berm cover to prevent soil erosion requires reconsideration as a shooting range management practice. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

abstract = {Realistic environmental interpretation of soil contamination depends on an understanding of how metals are bound to the various phases in the soil. A five-step sequential chemical extraction scheme, originally designed for sediment analysis by flame atomic adsorption spectroscopy (FAAS), has been developed for the multielement analysis of soils by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Each of the chemical fractions is operationally defined as follows: (1) exchangeable; (2) bound to carbonates or specifically adsorbed; (3) bound to FeMn-oxides; (4) bound to organic matter and sulphides; and (5) residual. The number of elements determined by ICP-AES has been extended to fifteen (Be, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Ti, V, Zn), which include most of the major elements, thereby increasing the potential of the sequential extraction method by enabling broader studies of geochemical associations in soils. The precision was estimated to be ∼ 5{\%} (2$\sigma$) for each extraction step. The overall recovery rates of international reference materials were between 85 and 110{\%} for most elements, with an average of 92{\%}. There is good agreement between the results for the international reference material (USGS MAG-1) in each extraction step and published values. A wide range of soil reference materials, including SO-1-SO-4 and BCR141-BCR143, were also analysed for future comparison. The application of the method to soils contaminated by past mining and smelting activities showed distinctive partitioning patterns of heavy metals from the two sources. The multielement measurements gave useful information to assist in the interpretation of the possible geochemical forms and sources of the trace elements in soils. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of tungstate sorption on the mineral boehmite ($\gamma$-AlOOH) were studied using batch uptake experiments and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Batch uptake experiments over the pH range 4-8 and [W]=50-2000$\mu$M show typical oxyanion behavior, and isotherm experiments reveal continued uptake with increasing tungstate concentration without any clear uptake maximum. Desorption experiments showed that sorption is irreversible at pH 4 and partly reversible at pH 8. Tungsten L1- and L3-edge XANES spectroscopy indicates that all sorbed tungstates are octahedrally coordinated, even though the dominant solution species at pH 8 is a tetrahedral monotungstate. Tungsten L3-edge EXAFS analysis shows that sorbed tungstate occurs as polymeric form(s), as indicated by the presence of corner- and edge-sharing of distorted tungstate octahedra. The occurrence of polymeric tungstate on the surface at pH 8 indicates that sorption is accompanied by polymerization and a coordination change from tetrahedral (in solution) to distorted octahedral (on the surface). The strong tendency for tungstate polymerization on boehmite can explain the continued uptake without an apparent maximum in sorption, and the limited desorption behavior. Our results provide the basis for a predictive model of tungstate uptake by boehmite, which can be important for understanding tungstate mobility, toxicity, and bioavailability.},

@article{Wasylenki2020,
abstract = {Tungsten is an emerging contaminant of interest with serious health implications whose environmental transport and fate have scarcely been studied. Sorption to mineral particles is likely the primary process controlling tungsten's mobility in oxidizing soils and aquifers, but the few papers published thus far have not yet resolved the relationships between aqueous speciation, substrate phases, and sorption complexes at conditions relevant to these settings. In many cases, these relationships are best investigated with techniques such as X-ray spectroscopy, but the low concentrations of tungsten in typical contaminated settings limit the applicability of that approach. Here, we lay initial groundwork for eventual use of the stable isotope geochemistry of tungsten to infer sorption mechanisms at field-relevant conditions, because metal stable isotope systematics are sometimes very sensitive to speciation and surface complexation geometry. We report the first tungsten stable isotope fractionations for soil-relevant conditions using simple batch experiments, in which tungsten interacted with either birnessite (Mn oxyhydroxide) or ferrihydrite (Fe oxyhydroxide) nanoparticles, at pH 5 or 8 and very low ionic strength. In 120-h experiments, in which proportions of sorbate and sorbent were varied, lighter isotopes of W preferentially sorbed on ferrihydrite. On a plot of $\delta$183/182W against {\%} W sorbed, parallel lines fit the pH 8 data from ferrihydrite experiments well, with a best fit $\Delta$183/182Wdissolved-sorbed of +0.39‰ (R2 = 0.95), indicating an equilibrium fractionation (reversible sorption in a closed system). Parallel, linear trends also fit the data from ferrihydrite experiments at pH 5 well, with a best-fit fractionation of +0.32‰ (R2 = 0.93). When error bars are propagated rigorously, these two $\Delta$183/182Wdissolved-sorbed values are indistinguishable, indicating that fractionation is insensitive to pH in the W-ferrihydrite system over the relevant range of pH and suggesting that sorption mechanism may also not vary with pH. In every birnessite experiment, lighter isotopes preferentially sorbed, but fractionation magnitude varied systematically with fraction of W sorbed, with larger fractionations at larger fraction of total W sorbed. At pH 8, the range in $\Delta$183/182Wdissolved-sorbed was +0.12 to +0.40‰, with an average of 0.31‰, and at pH 5, the range was +0.29 to +0.67‰, and the average was +0.47 ± 0.10‰. Isotope behavior and sorption mechanisms appear to be different for birnessite and more complicated compared to ferrihydrite; neither parallel lines (equilibrium trends) nor Rayleigh trends obviously fit all the data well. This observation led us to consider the possibility of a kinetic isotope effect superimposed on equilibrium fractionation, where the expressed mixture of kinetic and equilibrium fractionation varies with both surface loading and time. To explore further, we conducted experiments at pH 5 with fixed W/birnessite proportions and durations up to 504h. Results indicate that the amount of W sorbed to birnessite continues to increase gradually for at least 3 weeks. The magnitude of isotope fractionation also appears to increase gradually over time, from {\~{}}0.3‰ at ≤48 h. to {\~{}}0.6‰ at {\textgreater}100 h. We use multiple lines of indirect evidence to hypothesize that W initially sorbs directly to birnessite surfaces, but gradually a polymeric W-O surface precipitate phase assembles and grows, as observed in previous publications for W sorption on other substrates. In future work, we will attempt to confirm this hypothesis with X-ray spectroscopic analysis. Once the relationship between isotopic fractionation and sorption mechanism(s) are constrained, use of tungsten isotopes to probe sorption mechanisms at field-relevant concentrations of tungsten may be possible. In addition, inclusion of sorption-driven isotope systematics in reactive transport models may be useful in tracing W mobility in contaminated soils and sediments.},

@article{Kashiwabara2017,
abstract = {The similar, but not identical chemical properties of W compared with Mo suggest that the stable isotope system of W could be a novel proxy to explore the modern and ancient ocean as is the case in the well-established utility of Mo isotopes. We experimentally investigated the isotopic fractionation of W during adsorption on Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides (ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2), a key process in the global ocean budget of this element. Our adsorption experiments confirmed that W isotopes fractionate substantially on both ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2: lighter W isotopes are preferentially adsorbed on both oxides as a result of equilibrium isotopic exchange between dissolved and adsorbed species, and the obtained values of $\Delta$186/183Wliquid–solid ( = $\delta$186Wdissolved − $\delta$186Wadsorbed) are 0.76 ± 0.09‰ for ferrihydrite and 0.88 ± 0.21‰ for $\delta$-MnO2 (2$\sigma$, n = 6). Compared with the case of Mo isotopes, fractionation of W isotopes is (i) of comparable magnitude between ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2, and (ii) much smaller than that of Mo on $\delta$-MnO2. Our previous XAFS observations and newly-performed DFT calculations both indicate that the observed W isotopic fractionations are caused by the symmetry change from Td (tetrahedral) WO42− to distorted Oh (octahedral) monomeric W species via formation of inner-sphere complexes on both ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2. The similar isotopic fractionations between the two oxides relate to the strong tendency for W to form inner-sphere complexes, which causes the symmetry change, in contrast to the outer-sphere complex of Mo on ferrihydrite. The smaller isotopic fractionation of W compared with Mo on $\delta$-MnO2 despite their similar molecular symmetry seems to be due to their different degrees of distortion of Oh species. Our findings imply that the isotopic composition of W in modern oxic seawater is likely to become heavier relative to the input by removal of lighter W isotopes via adsorption on ferromanganese oxides in analogy with the Mo isotope budget. In contrast, the isotopic composition of W in ancient seawater should have evolved in response to the extent of deposition of both Fe and Mn oxides; this is likely to be different compared with that of the Mo isotopes, which is strongly associated with the occurrence of Mn oxides relative to Fe oxides.},

abstract = {Two industrial by products, red mud (RM) and aluminum-rich water treatment residue (Al-WTR) were used (2{\%}w/w) for the immobilization of As, Cu and Pb in two polluted soils. Soil-1 was a mine contaminated soil (2428 As, 234 Cu and 559 Pbmgkg-1); Soil-2 was a chromated copper arsenate contaminated soil (860 and 1500mgkg-1 of As and Cu respectively). Two different redox conditions (aerobic and 3 repeated reduction/oxidation cycles) were also applied. The immobilization of trace elements and their bioaccessibility were evaluated through a leaching test and simplified bioaccessibility extraction test (SBRC) respectively, whereas phytoavailability was assessed in pot trials with Lolium perenne.The RM addition increased the solubility of As and Pb, under both redox conditions, in Soil-1 with respect to untreated soil (i.e., +40 and 38{\%} respectively in RMsw-Soil-1 in aerobic condition). In Soil-2 Al-WTR was the amendment most efficient at decreasing As mobility ({\textless}50{\%} with respect to untreated soil). The high correlations detected between trace element mobility and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) suggests that As, Cu and Pb formed soluble organic complexes. The SBRC results suggested that this test was mainly affected by physical and chemical characteristics of soils, whereas trial pot showed that the treatments with RMsw and Al-WTR in aerobic condition were able to decrease the plant uptake of As by 34 and 57{\%} in Soil-1, and by 88 and 87{\%} in Soil-2. These treatments also reduced uptake of Cu from Soil-2 (by 68 and 86{\%}) and of Pb from Soil-1 (by 52 and 34{\%}).The results of this study show that the efficacy of the soil amendments is a complex function of soil conditions, source of contamination, and perhaps most importantly the environmental endpoint considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In our analytical approach, a nanoparticle separation technique is combined with multielement detection and applied to soil and river samples to link the macroscale field observations with detailed molecular studies in the laboratory. It was determined that lead is associated with iron oxide colloids, which are ubiquitous nanoparticles that can be efficiently transported. Eventually both iron oxides and lead are removed by flocculation under conditions of estuarine mixing.

abstract = {Mining operations disrupt the local groundwater balance both during and after mining. The galleries excavated during mining often require dewatering and thus restructure the groundwater flow. Then, once mining and dewatering have ceased, the mines flood and the groundwater attempts to attain a new chemical and dynamic equilibrium. Mine flooding in the Lorraine Iron Basin (France) over the past 20 years has resulted in a degradation of the groundwater quality, as indicated by high concentrations of SO4, Ca, Na, Mg, K, Mn and B, making it unsuitable for human consumption. Before new resource management schemes can be implemented, we must predict the long-term evolution of the groundwater's discharge and quality. Few spatially distributed data being available, a global approach has been adopted that consists in representing the iron basin as a network of chemical reactors. Flow rates through the network are calculated by processing available data records with an inverse rainfall-discharge model. Each reactor includes a specific chemical kinetic model for the rocks of the Lorraine Iron Basin (LIB), the kinetic constants having been determined from experimental studies. This approach was applied to the South Basin of the LIB, abandoned in 1995. The model can predict the concentration of major elements (SO4, Na, Ca, Mg and HCO3) in the groundwater at its overflow and gives an order of magnitude for elements such as K with lower concentrations. The global approach developed to model the evolution of groundwater quality when mines are flooded would seem to be well suited to the LIB case, probably due to the homogeneity in the distribution of the various types of mining methods at the mine reservoir scale. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Emerging electric-vehicle technologies and the global transition to renewable energy have driven the production of lithium batteries significantly in the past ten years. However, potential adverse impacts accompanying this transition require closer scrutiny. The purpose of this research is to assess the environmental impact and its possible correlation with lithium mining in the Atacama Salt Flat, the world's largest lithium extraction site. Using both Landsat imagery and MODIS land products, we investigate the mining areas to (1) determine area and rate of change over time, (2) analyze spatiotemporal patterns of changes in key environmental parameters, and (3) perform regression analysis between lithium mining activities and environmental degradation between 1997 and 2017. We use five environmental parameters for our analysis: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Daytime Land Surface Temperature (Day-LST), Soil Moisture Index (SMI), Nighttime Land Surface Temperature (Night-LST), and Net Evapotranspiration (ET). Our analysis shows that lithium mining operations have expanded rapidly by 7.07{\%} annually. Our pixel-based time-series trend analysis for each image stack, using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope coefficient, shows some significant degradation over the past 20 years including (1) vegetation decline, (2) elevating daytime temperatures, (3) decreasing trend of soil moisture, and (4) increasing drought condition in national reserve areas. However, no substantial degradation in nighttime-LST and ET is observed in the study area. Our analyses of the relationship between mining activities and environmental degradation also indicate that the continuous expansion of lithium mining has strong negative correlations with the NDVI and SMI, and a strong positive correlation with LST. We identified lithium mining activities as one of the major stressors to the local environmental degradation. The results provide a baseline to evaluate future socio-environmental impacts of lithium mining in the region. We anticipate our analysis will help inform mining and environmental regulators, lithium industry decision-makers, and national park managers to provide better management of the world's largest lithium production sites for a sustainable future.},

abstract = {According to the European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, the characterization of the content and source of heavy metals in soils are necessary to establish quality standards on a regional level that allow the detection of sampling sites affected by pollution. In relation to this, the surface horizons of 54 agricultural soils under vegetable crops in the Alicante province (Spain), a representative area of the European Mediterranean region, were sampled to determine the content of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn. Analytical determinations were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy after microwave sample digestion in acid solution. Results indicated that heavy metal levels were similar to those reported by authors working on agricultural soils from other parts of the Mediterranean region, with the exception of Cu and Pb in some samples. Multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and cluster analysis) was performed to identify a common source for heavy metals. Moreover, soil properties were determined in order to characterize agricultural soils and to analyze relationships between heavy metal contents and soil properties. The content of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn were associated with parent rocks and corresponded to the first principal component called the lithogenic component. A significant correlation was found between lithogenic metals and some soil properties such as soil organic matter, clay content, and carbonates, indicating an important interaction among them. On the other hand, elements such as Cd, Cu and Pb were related to anthropic activities and comprised the second (Cu and Pb) and third principal components (Cd), designated the anthropogenic components. Generally, Cd, Cu and Pb showed a lower correlation with soil properties due to the fact that they remain in available forms in these agricultural soils. Taking into account these results and other achieved in other parts of the European Mediterranean region, it can be concluded that soil quality standards are highly needed to declare soils affected by human induced pollution.

abstract = {Lead sorption efficiencies (sorption per specific surface area) were measured for a number of natural and synthetic Mn and Fe-oxides using a flow-through reactor. The Mn-oxide phases examined included synthetic birnessite, natural and synthetic cryptomelane, and natural and synthetic pyrolusite; the Fe-oxides studied were synthetic akagan{\'{e}}ite, synthetic ferrihydrite, natural and synthetic goethite, and natural and synthetic hematite. The sorption flow study experiments were conducted with 10 ppm Pb with an ionic strength of either 0.01 M NaNO3 or 0.01 M KNO3, both at pH 5.5. The experimental effluent solution was analyzed using aqueous spectroscopic methods and the reacted solids were analyzed using microscopy (field emission scanning electron microscopy, FE-SEM), structure analysis (powder X-ray diffraction, XRD), bulk chemical spectroscopy (energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS), and surface sensitive spectroscopy (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS). Overall and under these conditions, the synthetic Mn-oxides have higher sorption efficiencies than the natural Mn-oxides, which in turn are higher than the natural and synthetic Fe-oxides. Only natural pyrolusite had a sorption efficiency as low as the Fe-oxides. Most of the natural and synthetic Fe-oxides examined in this study removed about the same amount of Pb from solution once normalized to BET N2 surface area, although synthetic akagan{\'{e}}ite and hematite were significantly less reactive than the rest. It is suggested that the observed efficiency of Mn-oxides for Pb sorption is directly related to internal reactive sites in the structures that contain them (birnessite and cryptomelane, in the case of this study). Comparisons of solution data to XPS data indicated that Pb went into the interlayer of the birnessite, which was supported by XRD; similarly some Pb may go into the tunnels of the cryptomelane structure. Layer structures such as birnessite have the highest Pb sorption efficiency, while the 2 × 2 tunnel structure of cryptomelane has lower efficiencies than birnessite, but higher efficiencies than other Mn- or Fe-oxide structures without internal reactive sites. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A numerical flow model (MODFLOW) of the groundwater flow system in the primary aquifers in northern Arizona was developed to simulate interactions between the aquifers, perennial streams, and springs for predevelopment and transient conditions during 1910 through 2005. Simulated aquifers include the Redwall-Muav, Coconino, and basin-fill aquifers. Perennial stream reaches and springs that derive base flow from the aquifers were simulated, including the Colorado River, Little Colorado River, Salt River, Verde River, and perennial reaches of tributary streams. Simulated major springs include Blue Spring, Del Rio Springs, Havasu Springs, Verde River headwater springs, several springs that discharge adjacent to major Verde River tributaries, and many springs that discharge to the Colorado River. Estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties and groundwater budgets were developed from published reports and groundwater-flow models. Spatial extents of aquifers and confining units were developed from geologic data, geophysical models, a groundwater-flow model for the Prescott Active Management Area, drill logs, geologic logs, and geophysical logs. Spatial and temporal distributions of natural recharge were developed by using a water-balance model that estimates recharge from direct infiltration. Additional natural recharge from ephemeral channel infiltration was simulated in alluvial basins. Recharge at wastewater treatment facilities and incidental recharge at agricultural fields and golf courses were also simulated. Estimates of predevelopment rates of groundwater discharge to streams, springs, and evapotranspiration by phreatophytes were derived from previous reports and on the basis of streamflow records at gages. Annual estimates of groundwater withdrawals for agriculture, municipal, industrial, and domestic uses were developed from several sources, including reported withdrawals for nonexempt wells, estimated crop requirements for agricultural wells, and estimated per capita water use for exempt wells. Accuracy of the simulated groundwater-flow system was evaluated by using observational control from water levels in wells, estimates of base flow from streamflow records, and estimates of spring discharge. Major results from the simulations include the importance of variations in recharge rates throughout the study area and recharge along ephemeral and losing stream reaches in alluvial basins. Insights about the groundwater-flow systems in individual basins include the hydrologic influence of geologic structures in some areas and that stream-aquifer interactions along the lower part of the Little Colorado River are an effective control on water level distributions throughout the Little Colorado River Plateau basin. Better information on several aspects of the groundwater flow system are needed to reduce uncertainty of the simulated system. Many areas lack documentation of the response of the groundwater system to changes in withdrawals and recharge. Data needed to define groundwater flow between vertically adjacent water-bearing units is lacking in many areas. Distributions of recharge along losing stream reaches are poorly defined. Extents of aquifers and alluvial lithologies are poorly defined in parts of the Big Chino and Verde Valley sub-basins. Aquifer storage properties are poorly defined throughout most of the study area. Little data exist to define the hydrologic importance of geologic structures such as faults and fractures. Discharge of regional groundwater flow to the Verde River is difficult to identify in the Verde Valley sub-basin because of unknown contributions from deep percolation of excess surface water irrigation.},

abstract = {The Colorado Plateau's complex landscape has motivated over a century of debate, key to which is understanding the timing and processes of surface uplift of the greater Colorado Plateau region, and its interactions with erosion, drainage reorganization, and landscape evolution. Here, we evaluate what is known about the surface uplift history from prior paleoelevation estimates from the region by synthesizing and evaluating estimates 1) in context inferred from geologic, geomorphic, and thermochronologic constraints, and 2) in light of recent isotopic and paleobotanical proxy method advancements. Altogether, existing data and estimates suggest that half-modern surface elevations were attained by the end of the Laramide orogeny (∼40 Ma), and near-modern surface elevations by the mid-Miocene (∼16 Ma). However, our analysis of paleoelevation proxy methods highlights the need to improve proxy estimates from carbonate and floral archives including the ∼6–16 Ma Bidahochi and ∼34 Ma Florissant Formations and explore understudied (with respect to paleoelevation) Laramide basin deposits to fill knowledge gaps. We argue that there are opportunities to leverage recent advancements in temperature-based paleoaltimetry to refine the surface uplift history; for instance, via systematic comparison of clumped isotope and paleobotanical thermometry methods applied to lacustrine carbonates that span the region in both space and time, and by use of paleoclimate model mediated lapse rates in paleoelevation reconstruction.},

abstract = {The tungsten (W) species in marine ferromanganese oxides were investigated by wavelength dispersive XAFS method. We found that the W species are in distorted Oh symmetry in natural ferromanganese oxides. The host phase of W is suggested to be Mn oxides by $\mu$-XRF mapping. We also found that the W species forms inner-sphere complexes in hexavalent state and distorted Oh symmetry on synthetic ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite, and $\delta$-MnO2. The molecular-scale information of W indicates that the negatively-charged WO42- ion mainly adsorbs on the negatively-charged Mn oxides phase in natural ferromanganese oxides due to the strong chemical interaction. In addition, preferential adsorption of lighter W isotopes is expected based on the molecular symmetry of the adsorbed species, implying the potential significance of the W isotope systems similar to Mo.Adsorption experiments of W on synthetic ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2 were also conducted. At higher equilibrium concentration, W exhibits behaviors similar to Mo on $\delta$-MnO2 due to their formations of inner-sphere complexes. On the other hand, W shows a much larger adsorption on ferrihydrite than Mo. This is due to the formation of the inner- and outer-sphere complexes for W and Mo on ferrihydrite, respectively. Considering the lower equilibrium concentration such as in oxic seawater, however, the enrichment of W into natural ferromanganese oxides larger than Mo may be controlled by the different stabilities of their inner-sphere complexes on the Mn oxides. These two factors, (i) the stability of inner-sphere complexes on the Mn oxides and (ii) the mode of attachment on ferrihydrite (inner- or outer-sphere complex), are the causes of the different behaviors of W and Mo on the surface of the Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Heavy metal contamination of surface waters at mining sites often involves complex interactions of multiple sources and varying biogeochemical conditions. We compared surface and subsurface metal loading from mine waste pile runoff and mine drainage discharge and characterized the influence of iron oxides on metal fate along a 0.9-km stretch of Tar Creek (Oklahoma, USA), which drains an abandoned Zn/Pb mining area. The importance of each source varied by metal; mine waste pile runoff contributed 70{\%} of Cd, while mine drainage contributed 90{\%} of Pb, and both sources contributed similarly to Zn loading. Subsurface inputs accounted for 40{\%} of flow and 40-70{\%} of metal loading along this stretch. Streambed iron oxide aggregate material contained highly elevated Zn (up to 27,000$\mu$gg-1), Pb (up to 550$\mu$gg-1) and Cd (up to 200$\mu$gg-1) and was characterized as a heterogeneous mixture of iron oxides, fine-grain mine waste, and organic material. Sequential extractions confirmed preferential sequestration of Pb by iron oxides, as well as substantial concentrations of Zn and Cd in iron oxide fractions, with additional accumulation of Zn, Pb, and Cd during downstream transport. Comparisons with historical data show that while metal concentrations in mine drainage have decreased by more than an order of magnitude in recent decades, the chemical composition of mine waste pile runoff has remained relatively constant, indicating less attenuation and increased relative importance of pile runoff. These results highlight the importance of monitoring temporal changes at contaminated sites associated with evolving speciation and simultaneously addressing surface and subsurface contamination from both mine waste piles and mine drainage. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Extraction with deicing salt solution and sequential extraction were performed in order to elucidate the potential mobility due to the use of deicing agents. The total concentrations of elements, especially lead, have decreased and lead is presently almost at background concentrations (15-51 ppm for surface samples). However, the isotopic signature indicates that old gasoline lead still is left at the site constructed prior to 1975. The field site constructed in 1992 showed, however, no 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratio below 1.14. Only minor amounts were leached using deicing salt solutions; for lead only 0.29{\%}, on average, was extracted indicating that the mobile fraction already was released. Sequential extraction indicated that lead mainly was associated with reducible (34.4{\%}) and oxidisable (35.4{\%}) fractions. Exchangable and acid soluble fractions contained 20.3{\%} while 10.0{\%} was found in the residual fraction. The salt extraction released, however, very low concentrations indicating that most in fraction 1 is acid soluble (e.g. carbonates). Tungsten was also found at high concentrations indicating a possible impact from studded tires. For tungsten the following composition was obtained: residual (48.0{\%}) {\textgreater} oxidisable (47.6{\%}) {\textgreater} reducible (3.3{\%}) {\textgreater} exchangeable/acid soluble (1.1{\%}). From the isotopic studies it was also suggested that the order for incorporating anthropogenic lead into soils is exchange-able/carbonates {\textgreater} (hydr)oxides {\textgreater} organic matter {\textgreater} residual.

The source of tungsten was canister round munitions, composed mainly of tungsten (95{\%}) with iron and nickel making up the remaining fraction. Three soils were chosen for the lysimeter studies while four model soils were selected for the adsorption studies. Lysimeter soils were representatives of the typical range of soils across the continental USA; muck-peat, clay-loamy and sandy-quartzose soil. Adsorption equilibrium data on the four model soils were modeled with Langmuir and linear isotherms and the model parameters were obtained. The adsorption affinity of soils for tungsten follows the order: Pahokee peat{\textgreater}kaolinite{\textgreater}montmorillonite{\textgreater}illite. A canister round munition dissolution study was also performed. After 24d, the measured dissolved concentrations were: 61.97, 3.56, 15.83mgL-1 for tungsten, iron and nickel, respectively. Lysimeter transport studies show muck peat and sandy quartzose soils having higher tungsten concentration, up to 150mgkg-1 in the upper layers of the lysimeters and a sharp decline with depth suggesting strong retardation processes along the soil profile. The concentrations of tungsten, iron and nickel in soil lysimeter effluents were very low in terms of posing any environmental concern; although no regulatory limits have been established for tungsten in natural waters. The substantial uptake of tungsten and nickel by ryegrass after 120d of exposure to soils containing canister round munition suggests the possibility of tungsten and nickel entering the food chain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sediment-borne contamination in a watershed can be highly variable as a result of fluvial processes operating over a range of time scales. This study presents a detailed analysis of the distribution of one contaminant along an ephemeral stream after 55 years of sediment transport, deposition, and exchange by flash floods. Wastewater containing plutonium was discharged into the Pueblo Canyon watershed from 1945 until 1964, and plutonium concentrations in fluvial deposits vary over five orders of magnitude. These variations can be attributed to three primary factors: time since contaminant releases, particle-size sorting, and mixing of sediment from different sources. The highest concentrations occur in fine-grained sediment deposits near the source that date to the period of effluent releases, and concentrations are lower in younger deposits, in coarser-grained deposits, and in deposits farther downstream. The spatial distribution of plutonium is strongly affected by longitudinal variations in the size of sediment deposits of different age. A major aggradation-degradation cycle in the lower canyon overlapped with the period of active effluent releases, and a significant portion of the total plutonium inventory is contained within large coarse-grained deposits below fill terraces that postdate 1945. The spatial pattern of contamination is thus determined by the specific geomorphic history of the watershed, in addition to processes of mixing and sorting during transport that occur in all fluvial systems.},

When [HCO3-]/[Fe3+] = 0.5 and 0.6 (initial pH ∼ 2.1 and 2.2, respectively), the only large species formed were sulfate-complexed ferrihydrite-like molecular clusters that were stable throughout the duration of the experiment. When [HCO3-]/[Fe3+] = 1 (initial pH ∼ 2.5), ferrihydrite-like molecular clusters formed initially, but most later converted to schwertmannite. In contrast, when [HCO3-]/[Fe3+] = 2 (initial pH ∼ 2.7), schwertmannite and larger ferrihydrite particles formed immediately upon neutralization. However, the ferrihydrite particles subsequently converted to schwertmannite. The schwertmannite particles formed under both conditions aggregated extensively with increasing time. This work provides new insight into the formation, stability and reactivity of some early products that may form during the neutralization of natural acid mine drainage. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

For this study, the Tessier, Community Bureau of Reference (BCR), Short, Gal{\'{a}}n, and Geological Society of Canada (GCS) procedures were examined to clarify benefits and limitations of each. Modifications of the Tessier, BCR, and GCS procedures were also examined. The efficacy of these procedures is addressed by looking at the soils used in each procedure, the limitations, applications, and future of sequential extraction.},

abstract = {More knowledge of the geochemical behavior of tungsten (W) and associated contamination risks is needed. Therefore, weathering of scheelite (CaWO4) and secondary sequestration and transport of W to groundwater in historical skarn tailings and surface water downstream of the tailings were studied. The tailings contained 920 mg/kg W, primarily in scheelite. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses were combined to elucidate the geochemical behavior of W in the tailings, and water samples were taken monthly during 2018 to monitor its mobility. In the tailings, a large peak of W was found at 1.5 m depth. There, 30 wt{\%}. of W was present in easily reducible phases, indicating former scheelite weathering. Currently, W is being released from scheelite to water-soluble phases at 2.5 m depth. The release of WO42− is hypothetically attributed to anion exchange with CO32− released from calcite neutralizing acid produced from pyrrhotite oxidation in the upper tailings and transported downwards to pH conditions {\textgreater} 7. Higher concentrations of dissolved W were found in the groundwater and particulate W in downstream surface water than in reference water, but they were lower than current contamination thresholds. Tungsten showed correlations with hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) in both the tailings and surface water.},

abstract = {Reviewing the current state of knowledge about sequential extraction applied for soil vanadium (V) fractionation, we identified an urgent requirement of an sequential extraction (SE) specified for V. Namely, almost all previous SE extracted only 8.4{\%}–48{\%} of total V in soils (excluding residue). Thus, we proposed an eight-step SE for V fractionation in soils according to the knowledge gained from literature and our own dissolution experiments with model minerals. After extracting the mobilisable and adsorbed V with de-ionised water and 5 mmol/L phosphate, 1 mol/L pyrophosphate was applied to gather organic matter bound V which minimised the artefact dissolving Al and Fe (hydr)oxides occurred when using HNO3–H2O2 for extraction. Extraction with 0.4 mol/L NH2OH ⋅ HCl was highly selective toward manganese oxides. Fractionation of different crystalline Al and Fe (hydr)oxides associated V with 1 mol/L HCl, 0.2 mol/L oxalate buffer and 4 mol/L HCl at 95°C especially improved the extractability of V incorporated with crystalline phase associated V. The suitability of our new SE scheme was confirmed by its higher selectivity against the target phases and higher extraction efficiencies (55{\%}–77{\%} of total V) with model minerals and 6 soils of different properties than previous SE.},

abstract = {Two acid digestion procedures (microwave-assisted and room temperature) were developed for the quantitative analysis of ferromanganese nodules by inductively coupled plasma double focusing sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). Different compositions of the acid mixture, dilution factors and corrections for spectral interferences were tested. A combination of nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids is necessary for complete sample digestion, with lowest acid to sample ratios (v/m) of 15 and 1.5, respectively, for the last two acids. Sample dilution factors higher than 2 × 104 should be used in order to decrease matrix effects and provide robust long-term instrumental operation. In spite of high dilution, method detection limits in the sub-$\mu$g g−1 range were obtained for 54 out of 71 elements tested, due to the high detection capability of ICP-SFMS, as well as the special care taken to ensure the purity of reagents, to clean the instrument
sample introduction system and to minimise sample handling. Owing to the presence of unresolved (at the resolution available) spectral interferences, accurate determination of Au, Hg, Os, Pd, Re and Rh is impossible without matrix separation. The accuracy of the entire analytical method was tested by the analysis of two nodule reference materials. The results generated agreed to within ±2{\%} for about 10, within ±10{\%} for more than 40 and within ±20{\%} for about 50 of 53 elements for which certified, recommended or literature values are available. A precision better than 3{\%}, expressed as the between-digestion relative standard deviation (n = 4), was obtained for the majority of elements, except in cases limited by low analyte concentrations.},

abstract = {Ephemeral and intermittent flow in dryland stream channels infiltrates into sediments, replenishes groundwater resources and underpins riparian ecosystems. However, the spatiotemporal complexity of the transitory flow processes that occur beneath such stream channels are poorly observed and understood. We develop a new approach to characterise the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in dryland streams using pairs of temperature records measured at different depths within the streambed. The approach exploits the fact that the downward propagation of the diel temperature fluctuation from the surface depends on the sediment thermal diffusivity. This is controlled by time-varying fractions of air and water contained in streambed sediments causing a contrast in thermal properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with multi-level temperature and pressure records of a flow event acquired using 12 streambed arrays deployed along a ∼ 12 km dryland channel section. Thermal signatures clearly indicate the presence of water and characterise the vertical flow component as well as the occurrence of horizontal hyporheic flow. We jointly interpret thermal signatures as well as surface and groundwater levels to distinguish four different hydrological regimes: [A] dry channel, [B] surface run-off, [C] pool-riffle sequence, and [D] isolated pools. The occurrence and duration of the regimes depends on the rate at which the infiltrated water redistributes in the subsurface which, in turn, is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the variably saturated sediment. Our results have significant implications for understanding how transitory flows recharge alluvial sediments, influence water quality and underpin dryland ecosystems.},

abstract = {Groundwater samples were collected along two flow paths from the Aquia aquifer in Maryland, USA to investigate the rare earth element (REE) geochemistry of the flow system as a function of evolving groundwater composition. Neodymium (Nd) concentrations of Aquia aquifer groundwater range from 56.6 to 71.4pmolkg-1 along the Eastern Shore flow path (i.e., Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay), and from 41.5 to 77.9pmolkg-1 on the Western Shore flow paths, and consequently fall within the range reported for other circumneutral to alkaline pH groundwaters. Shale-normalized REE patterns of Eastern and Western Shore Aquia groundwaters are similar (i.e., relatively flat) and do not vary substantially along either flow path. For example, (Yb/Nd)NASC for Aquia aquifer groundwaters exhibit a limited range between 0.7 and 1.1. Aquia aquifer sediments were analyzed for REEs following a sequential extraction procedure. Neodymium concentrations for the bulk aquifer sediment range from 26 to 70$\mu$molkg-1 (3.7 to 10.1ppm), or a factor of 2.5 to 7 lower than the Nd content of the upper continental crust. The sequential extractions reveal that the majority of the REEs in the aquifer sediments occur associated with the abundant carbonate shell fragments that are ubiquitous within the Aquia aquifer sediments. Furthermore, the sequential extraction data indicate that the light REEs (LREE) are more readily exchangeable (i.e., outer sphere surface complexed) on aquifer mineral surfaces than the heavy REEs (HREE), and the HREEs and middle REEs (MREE) exhibit a greater association with Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides within the sediments. Analysis of the abundant glauconite pellets within Aquia aquifer sediments indicates an overall enrichment in the HREEs relative to the LREEs for this mineral, compared to shale. Our data suggest that the chief source of REEs to Aquia aquifer groundwater is dissolution of carbonate biominerals (shell fragments) that occurs in the recharge zone and before groundwaters become saturated with respect to calcite and aragonite. Additionally, weakly sorbed REEs (outer sphere surface complexed) contribute LREEs and MREEs to Aquia aquifer groundwater as pH increases above 8, leading to the relatively flat, shale-normalized REE patterns that characterize Aquia aquifer groundwaters. Once released to the solution, REE form strong aqueous complexes with carbonate ions, LnCO3+ and Ln(CO3)2-, with the dicarbonato complexes (i.e., Ln(CO3)2-) predominating. The REE are subsequently transported with flowing groundwater in the Aquia aquifer as the negatively charged dicarbonato complexes exhibit a low affinity to sorb to negatively charged mineral surfaces in the aquifer sediments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Yellow soil is a type of soil rich in hydrated iron oxide that is extensively distributed in the typical karst areas of Guizhou Province, southwest China. Concomitantly, the higher contents of metal(oid)s are observed in the soil of karst areas in Guizhou Province, and there are few reports to study the inner relationship between local soil and metal(oid)s in the here. Hence, the present study mainly aimed to understand the adsorption and desorption characteristics of metal(oid)s in yellow soils of a typical karst area using kinetics and adsorption isotherms. The effects of temperature, pH and electrolytes on adsorption were also examined. The risk of metal(oid)s in soil was also evaluated by geoaccumulation and tomlinson pollution load indexes. The results showed that the pH value of yellow soil collected from Guizhou Province was 6.41, making it a weakly acidic soil, and the average concentrations of organic matter and CaCO3 were approximately 1.12{\%} and 0.88{\%}, respectively. The adsorption of metal(oid)s did not significantly vary with an increase in the CaCO3 concentration in the yellow soil. The metal(oid)s adsorption of the yellow soil improved with an increasing clay content. The Hg content in the yellow soil far exceeded the standard value (GB 15618–2018), with a corresponding cumulative evaluation of grade 1 according to the geoaccumulation index. Tomlinson pollution load indexes exhibited that the comprehensive score of the selected metal(oid)s in the yellow soil was 0.60, corresponding to no pollution. The adsorption behavior of As onto the yellow soil can be interpreted through pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir model, where the maximum adsorption was observed at 1318 mg/kg. The adsorption of most metal(oid)s increased with increasing temperature. The adsorption of Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn and As did not obviously fluctuate with an increasing NaNO3 concentration. Notably, local related departments should take measures to decrease the Hg content in this soil.},

abstract = {Lead (Pb) is one of the most paradoxical elements, both having diverse practical uses, as well as being extremely toxic to humans, and especially to children. The use of Pb records a steady growth with annual production currently exceeding 10 million metric tons. In spite of the environmental awareness of modern society, humans are still exposed to Pb through its emission by smelting and mining activities, and also by Pb-bearing mine wastes and soils. Here, we review the chemical and mineralogical forms of Pb generated from smelting and mining processes and subsequently altered in tailings, slag piles, and soils. In smelter plumes, Pb is emitted to the atmosphere either in the form of smaller nano-size particulate matter (PM) often associated with S, or larger micrometer Pb-bearing PM matter accompanied by oxide-silicate matrices. Pb-bearing phases in mine tailings and impacted soils depict a greater mineralogical and chemical complexity than those emitted from smelters and the larger particle size of this PM also leads to a lower Pb bioavailability. High resolution observations in aquatic system, soils and rock coatings impacted by smelting and mining activities show the presence of Pb-bearing phosphates, sulfides, sulfates, carbonates, and oxide nanoparticles. Larger micrometer size particles of Pb-bearing minerals form often through the aggregation of Pb-bearing nanoparticles, a process commonly referred to as crystallization through particle attachment. Mobilization of Pb within soil columns is strongly affected by the transport of colloids, especially those composed of organic matter and Fe-hydroxides because Pb is taken up efficiently by these two soil components. The extraordinary variability and complexities of all of these processes suggest that future reduction of Pb contamination in the environment and its impact on human health mainly depends on eliminating or greatly reducing Pb-release from smelting operations and tailings impoundments.},

Practice with tungsten/nylon rounds began in 2000 subsequent to a 1997 US Environmental Protection Agency ban on training with lead. Training with the tungsten rounds was halted in 2005 because of concerns regarding tungsten's environmental mobility and potential toxicity. This study, therefore, examines how tungsten partitions in the environment when fired on a small arms training range. Soil sampling revealed surface soil concentrations, highest at the berm face, up to 2080 mg/kg. Concentrations decreased rapidly with depth-at least by an order of magnitude by 25 cm. Nonetheless, tungsten concentrations remained above background to at least 150 cm. Pore-water samples from lysimeters installed in berm areas revealed a range of concentrations ({\textless} 1-400 mg/L) elevated with respect to background although there was no discernable trend with depth. Groundwater monitoring well samples collected approximately 30 m below ground surface showed tungsten (0.001-0.56 mg/L) attributable to range use.},

abstract = {Nanoparticulate goethite, akaganeite, hematite, ferrihydrite and schwertmannite are important constituents of soils, sediments and mine drainage outflows. These minerals have high sorption capacities for metal and anionic contaminants such as arsenic, chromium, lead, mercury and selenium. Contaminant sequestration is accomplished mainly by surface complexation, but aggregation of particles may encapsulate sorbed surface species into the multigrain interior interfaces, with significant consequences for contaminant dispersal or remediation processes. Particularly for particle sizes on the order of 1–10 nm, the sorption capacity and surface molecular structure also may differ in important ways from bulk material. We review the factors affecting geochemical reactivity of these nanophases, focusing on the ways they may remove toxins from the environment, and include recent results of studies on nanogoethite growth, aggregation and sorption processes.},

abstract = {The environmental geochemistry of molybdenum and tungsten is not well known. To enable predictions of Mo and W concentrations in the presence of ferrihydrite (hydrous ferric oxide), batch equilibrations were made with MoO2-4, WO2-4, o -phosphate (PO3-4) and freshly prepared ferrihydrite suspensions in 0.01 M NaNO3 in the pH range from 3 to 10 at 25 °C. The results showed that WO2-4 is adsorbed more strongly than MoO2-4, and that both ions are able to displace PO3-4 from adsorption sites at low pH. Two models, the Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) and the CD-MUSIC Model (CDM), were tested in an effort to describe the data. In both models, the adsorption of MoO2-4 and WO2-4 could be described with the use of two monodentate complexes. One of these was a fully protonated complex, equivalent to adsorbed molybdic or tungstic acid, which was required to fit the data at low pH. This was found to be the case also for a data set with goethite. In competitive systems with PO3-4, the models did not always provide satisfactory predictions. It was suggested that this may be partly due to the uncertainty in the PO3-4 complexation constants. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hall1998,
abstract = {Analysis of soil and sediment samples, using selective extraction methods to distinguish different phases, is of particular interest in exploration geochemistry to locate deeply buried mineral deposits. There are various mechanisms of binding labile elements in the secondary environment, including physical and chemical sorption, precipitation, chelation and complexation. Phases present in soils and sediments which are likely to scavenge 'free' elements include amorphous Mn and Fe oxides, the humic and fulvic components of humus, and clays. This paper reviews these forms of trace elements and the methods in current use to quantify them. Examples of precision data, both for control and survey samples, are given with respect to trace elements dissolved from the 'soluble organic' component of humus, Mn oxides and amorphous Fe oxides. The high sensitivity of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is required to measure accurately and precisely a large suite of trace elements, especially where only small fractions of elements are dissolved by such leaches as the commercially available Enzyme and MMI (Mobile Metal Ion) extractions. The relative standard deviations (RSD) obtained for 33 elements (e.g. Ag, Cd, In, I) in the standard reference sample (SRM), TILL-2, are in the range 0.5-8{\%} for the hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH.HCl) leach designed to extract hydrous Fe and Mn oxides. The corresponding RSDs for elements in the reactive Mn oxide phase extracted by the Enzyme leach are in the range 3-19{\%} except for some trace elements at levels close to detection limit (e.g. Cd, Bi). The RSDs obtained for field duplicates are inferior to those for analytical replicates (i.e. sample splits), probably a reflection of different concentrations of the host phase. In one soil survey, the Fe extracted by a 0.25 M NH2OH.HCl leach ranged conservatively from 0.2 to 1.7{\%} whereas the Mn extracted by the Enzyme leach varied extensively, from 0.3 to {\textgreater} 999 ppm. In contrast, precision, at 1-7{\%} RSD, for field duplicates was found to be comparable with that for both analytical duplicates and the SRM, LKSD-4, for elements associated with the humic and fulvic component of humus samples sieved to {\textless} 177 ‰m.},

Experimental results obtained on replicate samples of fluvial bottom sediments demonstrate that the relative standard deviation of the sequential extraction procedure is generally better than ±10{\%}. The accuracy, evaluated by comparing total trace metal concentrations with the sum of the five individual fractions, proved to be satisfactory. Complementary measurements were performed on the individual leachates, and on the residual sediments following each extraction, to evaluate the selectivity of the various reagents toward specific geochemical phases. An application of the proposed method to river sediments is described, and the resulting trace metal speciation is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

Two soil extraction procedures were used without significant correlation between the methods at all stages, with the exception of copper and arsenic. More importantly, perhaps, the bioaccumulation by various tissues of Buxus sempervirens did not significantly correlate for the majority of target metals for each extraction procedure. Possible accumulation of toxic cations by a dying tree species was also examined.

abstract = {Knowledge of trace elements and their role in the life-cycle is of great importance. Almost a hundred species of alkylated metals and metal(loid)s have been found in different ecosystems. The level of contaminants can be very low (at ng range per dm3 or kg) or very high and can come from natural sources or be a result of an enrichment. Whether through natural or anthropogenic activities, when metal ions enter the environment or living systems, only a fraction will remain as free ions. In general, the major portion will be complexed by ligands and can result in different species with specific behavior in the system, resulting in several bio(geo)chemical processes (Lobinski 1997, Hirner 2006). For example, natural methylation, which is generally prevalent in metal ions under specific conditions, can result in much more or less toxic species, depending on the element. Another example is the possibility of metal ions being incorporated into large molecular structures such as humic substances. On the other hand, due to different anthropogenic activities, some species can enter the environment, for example, lead and tin species (Cornelis et al. 2003, Hirner 2006).},

abstract = {A compilation of 68 studies from throughout many of the world's mountain belts reveals an empirically consistent and linear relationship between change in elevation and change in the isotopic composition of precipitation along altitudinal transects. The isotopic composition of precipitation decreases linearly with increasing elevation in most regions of the world except in the Himalayas and at elevations {\textgreater} 5000 m. There are no significant differences in isotopic lapse rates from most regions of the world (∼0.28 permil/100 m) except at the extreme latitudes where isotopic lapse rates are higher. Given information on past changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation preserved in pedogenic or authigenic minerals, this global isotopic lapse rate can be used to place numerical constraints on the topographic development of some ancient mountain belts or plateaus. There are many complicating factors that can confound interpretation of paleoelevation change based on stable isotopes, and many of these are unique to specific mountain belts or time periods. Relevant to all stable isotope based paleoelevation change studies is the temperature dependent isotope fraction ation between a pedogenic or authigenic mineral and the water from which it forms. In cases where isotopic proxy minerals are sampled from localities where temperature will change simultaneously with elevation change, the apparent change in the isotopic composition of precipitation may be dampened by several permil. This suggests that samples taken from the rainshadow side of an emerging orographic barrier may be more likely to preserve isotopic changes resulting from mountain uplift than samples taken from atop a rising mountain range or plateau.},

abstract = {A new sequential extraction scheme for acid sulfate soil materials has been evaluated for iron partitioning in a range of synthetic iron-bearing minerals and natural acid sulfate soil materials. This sequential extraction procedure employs six steps to quantify (1) exchangeable (magnesium chloride extractable), (2) acid (hydrochloric acid) soluble, (3) reactive organic-bound (pyrophosphate extractable), (4) crystalline oxide (citrate buffered dithionite (CBD)) extractable, (5) pyrite-bound (nitric acid extractable) and (6) residual (acid/peroxide digestible) forms of iron. Given its intended use for acid sulfate soil materials that frequently contain pyrite, a primary aim of this new sequential extraction procedure was to differentiate iron bound in pyrite from iron contained in other minerals. The results demonstrated that dissolution of pyrite was effectively isolated in the pyrite-bound extraction step, with dissolution of other iron mineral phases (i.e. akaganeite, ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite, jarosite, magnetite, and schwertmannite) occurring within the other five extraction steps. Following a systematic examination of these synthetic iron mineral phases, the sequential extraction scheme was applied to an acid sulfate soil profile, with detailed data presented for two soil layers: one representative of the sulfidic (unoxidised) conditions, and the other sulfuric (oxidised) conditions. Partitioning data for pyrite-bound iron in the acid sulfate soil profile showed good agreement with that calculated via the independently measured pyrite-bound reduced sulfur. This study indicates that the new sequential extraction procedure is suitable for the assessment of iron partitioning in acid sulfate soil materials. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Considerable questions persist regarding tungsten geochemistry in natural systems, including which forms of tungsten are found in soils and how adsorption regulates dissolved tungsten concentrations. In this study, we examine tungsten speciation and solubility in a series of soils at firing ranges in which tungsten rounds were used. The metallic, mineral, and adsorbed forms of tungsten were characterized using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray microprobe, and desorption isotherms for tungsten in these soils were used to characterize its solid-solution partitioning behavior. Data revealed the complete and rapid oxidation of tungsten metal to hexavalent tungsten(VI) and the prevalence of adsorbed polymeric tungstates in the soils rather than discrete mineral phases. These polymeric complexes were only weakly retained in the soils, and porewaters in equilibrium with contaminated soils had 850 mg L-1 tungsten, considerably in excess of predicted solubility. We attribute the high solubility and limited adsorption of tungsten to the formation of polyoxometalates such as W12SiO404-, an $\alpha$-Keggin cluster, in soil solutions. Although more research is needed to confirm which of such polyoxometalates are present in soils, their formation may not only increase the solubility of tungsten but also facilitate its transport and influence its toxicity.},

abstract = {Interest in tungsten occurrence and geochemistry is increasing due to increased use of tungsten compounds and its unknown biochemical effects. Tungsten has a complex geochemistry, existing in most environmental matrices as the soluble and mobile tungstate anion, as well as poly- and heteropolytungstates. Because the geochemistry of tungsten is substantially different than most trace metals, including the formation of insoluble species under acidic conditions, it is not extracted from soil matrices using standard acid digestion procedures. Therefore, the current work describes a modification to a commonly used acid digestion procedure to facilitate quantification of tungsten in soil matrices. Traditional soil digestion procedures, using nitric and hydrochloric acids with hydrogen peroxide yield {\textless}1 up to 50{\%} recovery on soil matrix spike samples, whereas the modified method reported here, which includes the addition of phosphoric acid, yields spike recoveries in the 76-98{\%} range. Comparison of the standard and modified digestion procedures on National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Materials yielded significantly improved tungsten recoveries for the phosphoric acid modified method. The modified method also produces comparable results for other acid extractable metals as the standard methods, and therefore can be used simultaneously for tungsten and other metals of interest.},

abstract = {Water samples were collected from 10 locations along the Truckee River system, 14 locations along the Walker River system, and 12 locations along the Carson River, and analyzed for B, Mo, V, W, Na, Cl, and pH. Boron concentrations ranged from approximately 2 $\mu$mol/kg in the upper reaches of the Truckee River to almost 1,200 $\mu$mol/kg in Pyramid Lake. Molybdenum, V, and W had concentrations in the nanomolal range; Mo varied from a low of about 12 nmol/kg to a high of 3,200 nmol/kg (Walker Lake); V ranged from 9 nmol/kg to approximately 470 nmol/kg; and W varied from a low value around 0.8 nmol/kg (West Walker River) to 1,030 nmol/kg. The high concentrations of these oxyanion-forming trace elements in the rivers reflects (1) the relative stability of these oxyanions (e.g., MoO42-, HVO42-, WO42-, B(OH)3, and/or B(OH)4-) in the alkaline, well oxygenated river and lake waters, (2) contributions of hydrothermal waters (especially for B), and weathering of rocks/regolith with high concentrations of these elements. In the case of Mo, V, and W, each exhibited relatively conservative behavior in the upper, oxygenated reaches of all three rivers. During the study period the region experienced a prolonged drought such that the lower reaches of each river were typified by no flow or stagnant waters and probably low oxygen and/or anoxic conditions (although not measured). Reductive processes occurring in the low flow to stagnant reaches of each river could have led to removal of Mo, V, and W from solution as coprecipitates with Fe manosulfides, or via sorption to Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides and/or organic matter. Boron, however, exhibited essentially no or minor removal from these rivers, and instead was added to each river via B-rich hydrothermal waters (e.g., Steamboat Creek from Steamboat Hot Springs), or by B-rich groundwaters via base-flow during the extensive drought.},

An intermediate protocol was also evaluated in which 0.5 mol L-1 hydroxylammonium chloride at pH 2 was used. The procedures were applied to five soil and sediment substrates: a sewage sludge-amended soil, two different industrially contaminated soils, a river sediment and an inter-tidal sediment. Extractable iron and manganese concentrations were measured to assess the effects of the procedural modifications on dissolution of the reducible matrix components. Trace elements copper, lead and zinc were also determined. Statistical analysis (two-tailed t-tests at 95 {\%} confidence interval) indicated that recovery of iron in step 2 was not markedly enhanced when the intermediate protocol was used. However, significantly greater amounts were isolated with the revised BCR scheme than with the original procedure. Copper behaved similarly to iron. Lead recoveries were increased by use of both modified protocols, with the greatest effect occurring for the revised BCR extraction. In contrast, manganese and zinc extraction did not vary markedly between procedures. The work indicates that the revised BCR sequential extraction provides better attack on the iron-based components of the reducible matrix for a wide range of soils and sediments. brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk},

abstract = {Despite the global abundance of arid-region ephemeral streams, hydrologic and geomorphic data for these systems are limited compared to their perennial counterparts. High spatial and temporal variability in flow makes hydrologic and geomorphic aspects of dryland ephemeral channels difficult to characterize. Perennial stream classifications have been extended to dryland ephemeral streams but do not adequately describe observed differences in channel geometry and characteristics of ephemeral channels in desert environments. We present a geomorphic classification for ephemeral streams in mountainous regions based on planform, degree of confinement, and composition of confining material. Five stream types were identified in the Sonoran desert of southwestern Arizona: (1) piedmont headwater, (2) bedrock, (3) bedrock with alluvium, (4) incised alluvium, and (5) braided channels. Nonparametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance for 101 surveyed reaches indicated differences (p{\textless}. 0.001) in channel geometry and hydraulics among the five stream types. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination identified the strongest channel geometry and hydraulic variables capable of distinguishing the five channel types, and a classification tree determined relative importance of these variables in the following order: width-to-depth ratio (W/D), stream gradient (S), stream power ($\Omega$), and shear stress ($\tau$). A classification tree and discriminant analysis used W/D, S, $\Omega$, and $\tau$ for 86 study reaches on the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (77{\%} and 77{\%} internal validation hit rate, respectively) to predict stream type of 15 separate study reaches on Barry Goldwater Air Force Range with 67{\%} and 73{\%} external validation hit rates, respectively. Differences in channel geometry among the five stream types reflect likely differences in hydrology, hydraulics, and sediment transport with implications for disturbance regime, channel adjustment to disturbance, and ecological sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Tungsten is recognized as a critical metal due to its unique properties, economic importance, and limited sources of supply. It has wide applications where hardness, high density, high wear, and high-temperature resistance are required, such as in mining, construction, energy generation, electronics, aerospace, and defense sectors. The two primary tungsten minerals, and the only minerals of economic importance, are wolframite and scheelite. Secondary tungsten minerals are rare and generated by hydrothermal or supergene alteration rather than by atmospheric weathering. There are no reported concerns for tungsten toxicity. However, tungsten tailings and other residues may represent severe risks to human health and the environment. Tungsten metal scrap is the only secondary source for this metal but reprocessing of tungsten tailings may also become important in the future. Enhanced gravity separation, wet high-intensity magnetic separation, and flotation have been reported to be successful in reprocessing tungsten tailings, while bioleaching can assist with removing some toxic elements. In 2020, the world's tungsten mine production was estimated at 84 kt of tungsten (106 kt WO3), with known tungsten reserves of 3400 kt. In addition, old tungsten tailings deposits may have great potential for exploration. The incomplete statistics indicate about 96 kt of tungsten content in those deposits, with an average grade of 0.1{\%} WO3 (versus typical grades of 0.3–1{\%} in primary deposits). This paper aims to provide an overview of tungsten minerals, tungsten primary and secondary resources, and tungsten mine waste, including its environmental risks and potential for reprocessing.},

abstract = {More knowledge of the geochemical behavior of tungsten (W) and associated contamination risks is needed. Therefore, weathering of scheelite (CaWO4) and secondary sequestration and transport of W to groundwater in historical skarn tailings and surface water downstream of the tailings were studied. The tailings contained 920 mg/kg W, primarily in scheelite. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses were combined to elucidate the geochemical behavior of W in the tailings, and water samples were taken monthly during 2018 to monitor its mobility. In the tailings, a large peak of W was found at 1.5 m depth. There, 30 wt{\%}. of W was present in easily reducible phases, indicating former scheelite weathering. Currently, W is being released from scheelite to water-soluble phases at 2.5 m depth. The release of WO42− is hypothetically attributed to anion exchange with CO32− released from calcite neutralizing acid produced from pyrrhotite oxidation in the upper tailings and transported downwards to pH conditions {\textgreater} 7. Higher concentrations of dissolved W were found in the groundwater and particulate W in downstream surface water than in reference water, but they were lower than current contamination thresholds. Tungsten showed correlations with hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) in both the tailings and surface water.},

abstract = {Tungsten is a metal with many industrial and military applications, including manufacturing of commercial and military ammunition. Despite its widespread use, the potential environmental effects of tungsten are essentially unknown. This study addresses environmental effects of particulate and soluble forms of tungsten, and to a minor extent certain tungsten alloy components, present in some munitions formulations. Dissolution of tungsten powder significantly acidifies soils. Tungsten powder mixed with soils at rates higher than 1{\%} on a mass basis, trigger changes in soil microbial communities resulting in the death of a substantial portion of the bacterial component and an increase of the fungal biomass. It also induces the death of red worms and plants. These effects appear to be related with the soil acidification occurring during tungsten dissolution. Dissolved tungsten species significantly decrease microbial yields by as much as 38{\%} for a tungsten media concentration of 89 mg l-1. Soluble tungsten concentrations as low as 10-5 mg l-1, cause a decrease in biomass production by 8{\%} which is possibly related to production of stress proteins. Plants and worms take up tungsten ions from soil in significant amounts while an enrichment of tungsten in the plant rhizosphere is observed. These results provide an indication that tungsten compounds may be introduced into the food chain and suggest the possibility of development of phytoremediation-based technologies for the cleanup of tungsten contaminated sites. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Additions of As-bearing phases to wetland and riverbed sediment subsamples were quantitatively recovered by the following extractants of the sequential extraction procedure: As adsorbed on goethite, 1 M NaH2PO4; arsenic trioxide (As2O3), 10 M HF; arsenopyrite (FeAsS), 16 N HNO3; amorphous As sulfide, 1 N HCl, 50 mM Ti-citrate-EDTA, and 16 N HNO3; and orpiment (As2S3), hot concentrated HNO3/H2O2. Wet sediment subsamples from both highly contaminated wetland peat and less As-rich sandy riverbed sediment were used to test the extraction procedure for intra-method reproducibility. The proportional distribution of As among extractant pools was consistent for subsamples of the wetland and for subsamples of the riverbed sediments. In addition, intermethod variability between the sequential extraction procedure and a single-step hot concentrated HNO3/H2O2 acid digestion was investigated. The sum of the As recovered in the different extractant pools was not significantly different than results for the acid digestion.},

abstract = {Mining of mineral resources exerts strong impact on the environment and leads to irreversible changes in vegetation, soils, atmosphere, surface and ground waters. The aim of this study is to assess the modern geochemical state of soil cover in Zakamensk, a city located in Buryat Republic (Russia) and known as one of the biggest ore mining center in the former Soviet Union. The center was operating for 68 years and closed 17 years ago. Soil-geochemical survey was conducted in 2012 and included collection of 103 soil samples in Zakamensk and 27 samples in the background areas. The bulk contents of 16 potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the soil samples were determined by mass spectrometry and by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. Background sites are characterized by increased concentrations of ore elements W and Mo. The mineral deposit development and physical and chemical weathering of tailings' material have led to a sharp increase in Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, W and Zn levels in the soils of different land-use areas. Near the tailings, the concentration of Sb in soils was 356 times higher than in the background area; Cd – 70 times; Mo, Bi, Cu, and W – 42–55 times; Pb and As – 34–37 times; and Zn and Sn – 6–12 higher. In the north of the city a prominent anomaly of PTEs occurs in sandy sediments of the Modonkul floodplain. It was formed due to the washout and subsequent sedimentation of suspended matter carried by the Modonkul River from the Barun–Naryn, the Dzhida, and emergency tailings. So, the anthropogenic activities are the most important source of ore and accompanying elements in the urban soils. High levels of accessory elements also depends on natural factors such as physicochemical properties of soils, position in the landscape, and genesis of parent materials. The environmental assessment of topsoils in Zakamensk showed that Pb, Sb, Cd, and As concentrations exceeds the Russian MPCs by 1.7–7.8 times, which creates a significant hazard for the environment and adversely affects human health.},

abstract = {To improve understanding of possible connections between airborne tungsten and public health, size and geography of airborne tungsten particles collected in Fallon, Nevada, and Sweet Home, Oregon, were compared. Both towns have industrial tungsten facilities, but only Fallon has experienced a cluster of childhood leukemia. Fallon and Sweet Home are similar to one another by their particles of airborne tungsten being generally small in size. Meteorologically, much, if not most, of residential Fallon is downwind of its hard metal facility for at least some fraction of time at the annual scale, whereas little of residential Sweet Home is downwind of its tungsten facility. Geographically, most Fallon residents potentially spend time daily within an environment containing elevated levels of airborne tungsten. In contrast, few Sweet Home residents potentially spend time daily within an airborne environment with elevated levels of airborne tungsten. Although it cannot be concluded from environmental data alone that elevated airborne tungsten causes childhood leukemia, the lack of excessive cancer in Sweet Home cannot logically be used to dismiss the possibility of airborne tungsten as a factor in the cluster of childhood leukemia in Fallon. Detailed modeling of all variables affecting airborne loadings of heavy metals would be needed to legitimately compare human exposures to airborne tungsten in Fallon and Sweet Home. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012 Paul R.

abstract = {The pore-water geochemistry and mineralogy of tailings derived from a granitic tungsten deposit were characterized by collecting pore-water samples at discrete depth intervals throughout the tailings for the analysis of major and minor element concentrations. Mineralogical samples from the oxidation zone were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), electron microprobe (EMP) combined with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The oxidation of sulfide minerals in the near-surface tailings leads to a decrease in pore-water pH and elevated SO4, As, and metal concentrations. The unusual mineralogy of this deposit, compared with that of commonly studied base-metal and gold deposits, results in several unique geochemical characteristics. The dissolution of fluorite releases F into the pore water; the F forms strong complexes with Al and enhances the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals within the oxidation zone. As a result, high Al concentrations (up to 151.7 mg/L) are detected in the near-neutral pore water in the oxidation zone. The combined dissolution of aluminosilicates and carbonate minerals maintains the pH near 10 in the pore water at depth. Elevated concentrations of W (up to 7.1 mg/L) are detected in the pore water throughout the tailings, likely as a result of the dissolution of wolframite. Consistent with geochemical model calculations, results from SEM/EDS, EMP/WDS and TEM/EDS analyses indicate that secondary minerals, which occur as orange-brown coatings on grains of primary-minerals, are Fe oxyhydroxides. Examples of these secondary minerals display a fibrous habit at high resolution in the TEM. One of these minerals, which contains substantial amounts of Al, As, and Si as impurities, was identified by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses to be goethite. Another mineral contains relatively high amounts of Si, Pb, Bi, and As, and SAED analyses suggest that the mineral is two-line ferrihydrite. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

The analytical procedure involves chemical dissolution of the Fe–Mn oxides and addition of a thulium (Tm) spike. The correction of measured values from potential isobaric interferences was investigated using both corrections based on mono-elemental solutions, and data acquisition in the high-resolution mode. The obtained results show that the high-resolution acquisition mode is unnecessary to achieve high quality data for REE in Fe–Mn oxides.

We reconstruct the middle and late Cenozoic topography along a transect that extends from the Great Plains of western Nebraska across the central Rockies in Wyoming, based on reconstructed surface-water $\delta$D values from volcanic glass $\delta$D values. Our data show gradual increases of surface-water $\delta$D values in both the central Rockies and adjacent Great Plains during middle and late Cenozoic time, and the establishment of a similar-to-present surface-water $\delta$D gradient between the central Rockies and western Great Plains before earliest Oligocene time. These observations suggest that the region underwent differential uplift to form relief similar to that of today before earliest Oligocene time. This uplift has caused regional drying and the gradual increase of surface-water $\delta$D values over the past 35 m.y.

Our X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis resolved wolframite in TOPR with a distorted octahedral coordination. The sequential extraction procedure showed that 78{\%} of mobile fraction W in TOPR were bound to Fe oxides, and consequently W leachability was positively correlated with dissolved Fe concentration as evidenced by the general acid neutralizing capacity (GANC) test. The GANC results showed that the W release was negatively correlated with Ca concentration due to CaWO4 precipitation. The in vitro gastrointestinal procedure (IVG) results indicated that organic acids, abundant in fruits and vegetables, significantly improved the bioaccessibility of W from 10{\%} to 20{\%} of total W in TOPR. As a consequence, accidental ingestion of TOPR with a chemical daily intake at 0.8 mg kg−1 day−1 evidenced its emerging concern in the environment and human health.},

abstract = {In the past, very little guidance has been available for site characterization activities addressing the concentration and mass of energetic residues in military training range soils. Energetic residues are heterogeneously distributed over military training ranges as particles of various sizes, shapes, and compositions. Most energetic residues are deposited on the surface, and the highest concentrations exist at firing positions, near targets, and where demolition activities are performed. In the case of impact and demolition ranges the greatest quantities of residues are from rounds that fail to detonate as designed. To address the compositional and distributional heterogeneity associated with the distribution of particles and to obtain representative mean energetic residue soil concentrations, the sampling strategy must strive for the acquisition of samples that contain the constituents of concern in the same proportion to the bulk matrix as exists within the decision unit (sampled area, population, or exposure unit). This report summarizes the sampling strategies and designs that have been implemented for various types of military ranges, including hand grenade, antitank rocket, artillery, bombing, and demolition ranges. These protocols were developed during investigations on active ranges and primarily addressed potential surface source zones from which energetic residues could be migrating into surface and groundwater systems. A multi-increment sampling strategy was selected to accomplish this task after exposing the inadequacies of discrete sampling.},

Determining the risk associated within AMD generation and metal(loid) transport from coal mine spoil is complicated by the heterogeneous natural of spoil heaps and mineralogical and hydro(bio)geochemical factors that may limit or promote metal(loid) transport. The current work aims to determine if primary, reduced phases such as pyrite continue to persist in abandoned and historic coal mine spoil. This objective was accomplished through characterization soils undergoing active weathering while developing on coal mine spoil in Appalachian Ohio to determine the factors that might limit oxidative dissolution. Soils in the Huff Run Watershed (Ohio, USA) were sampled at 0–10 cm, 30–40 cm, 70–80 cm, and 110–120 cm depth. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and synchrotron-based X-ray Microprobe (XMP) analyses were used to determine the speciation and distribution of metal(loid)s and the minerals they are associated with. The XMP analyses included micro-focused XRD ($\mu$-XRD), X-ray Fluorescence ($\mu$-XRF) element and redox state mapping, and X-ray absorption Near Edge Structure ($\mu$-XANES) Spectroscopy. Soil mineralogy was dominated by quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and feldspar, with minor amounts of chlorite and other phases including pyrite, arsenopyrite, realgar, orpiment, hematite, and goethite. Soils from all depths contained metal(loid)-sulfide particles with secondary mineral surface coatings, often in physically complex and heterogeneous aggregates that were composed of clay minerals and secondary Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides. These assemblages were typically 10–20 $\mu$m in diameter, with an individual pyrite particle core grain size ranging from 0.5 to 10 $\mu$m, and secondary mineral surface coatings ranging in thickness from undetectable to 1 $\mu$m. Within these aggregates, S and As were present as: (1) small ({\textless}20 $\mu$m) phases that were spatially correlated with Fe and other trace metal(loids) (Cu, Se, and Zn) and identified as metal(loid)-sulfide minerals; and (2) As(III), As(VI), and S(VI) associated with secondary Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides. Intermediate S oxidation state was also observed to be associated with remnant coal and organic matter. These results indicate that pyrite and other metal(loid) sulfides are present in soils developing on historic coal mine spoil after several decades since waste emplacement. The persistence of the $\mu$m-scale pyrite grains is likely the result of the formation of the secondary mineral surface coatings which can limit complete oxidative dissolution. These phases also play a role in re-sequestration of metal(loid)s release from sulfide mineral weathering. This work highlights the importance for considering AMD generation from non-point sources, and the potential for long-term ecosystem impairment.},

abstract = {Geothermal waters usually have elevated tungsten concentrations, making geothermal systems important sources of tungsten in the environment. To study the transport of tungsten in hot springs to hot spring sediment, which is one of the key processes for the release of geothermally derived tungsten to the surface environment, geochemical investigations of the hot springs and their corresponding sediments in Rehai (a representative hydrothermal area in southwestern China) and systematic laboratory experiments of tungstate and polytungstate adsorption onto typical iron-bearing minerals in hot spring sediments (i.e., pyrite and goethite) were conducted. The results demonstrate that considerable tungsten concentrations (i.e., not much less than 10 µg/L), formation of polytungstates under acidic conditions, and enrichment of iron oxide minerals represented by goethite are the prerequisites for extreme enrichment of tungsten in hot spring sediments (e.g., 991 µg/g in the ZZQ spring outflow channel). The absence of any of these conditions would weaken the immobilization of aqueous tungsten and result in higher mobility of tungsten in the hot springs and its further transport downstream, possibly polluting the other natural waters in and around Rehai that serve as local drinking water sources. This study provides an insight for identifying the key geochemical processes controlling the transport and fate of undesirable elements (in this case, tungsten) in geothermal systems.},

abstract = {Tungsten stable isotopes hold great potential to examine a variety of physical and chemical processes operating during the accretion and differentiation of asteroids and terrestrial planets, such as core formation and mantle–crust differentiation. To assess the magnitude and origin of W isotope fractionations, we determined the W stable isotopic compositions of six USGS geological reference materials, a NIST steel, and 24 iron meteorites and chondrites. The W isotope data were obtained using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) and using a 180W–183W double spike. Chondrites and iron meteorites exhibit a very narrow range in W stable isotope compositions, resulting in a mean $\delta$184/183W = 0.027 ± 0.007‰ (95{\%} conf.) relative to the NIST 3163 W standard. This value represents a good estimate for the W stable isotope composition of bulk planetary bodies from the inner solar system. The $\delta$184/183W of some iron meteorites slightly deviates from this value, most likely due to W isotope fractionations induced during crystallization of the metal cores of iron meteorite parent bodies. The investigated terrestrial silicate rocks exhibit a narrow range in $\delta$184/183W, which for most samples is indistinguishable from the mean value of chondrites and iron meteorites. However, felsic samples tend to be isotopically lighter than mafic samples, indicating that magmatic processes on Earth induced W isotope fractionations. These fractionations are possibly related to the fluid-mobility of W in subduction zones, but more data are needed to test this hypothesis. Given that most terrestrial igneous rocks are isotopically indistinguishable from chondrites and iron meteorites, core formation on Earth does not seem to have induced a measurable isotopic fractionation for W. However, more data are needed to firmly arrive at this conclusion.},

abstract = {This laboratory study addresses issues related to the fate and transport of tungsten and tungsten oxides in the environment (soil-water). Tungsten dioxide and tungsten trioxide were dissolved in aqueous solutions whose pH had been adjusted from 4.0 to 11.0. For initial pH smaller than 10.0, dissolved tungsten concentration remained fairly constant at around 10.0 mg/L for WO2 and increased from 0.3 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L for WO3 with increasing values of initial pH. Large amounts of dissolved tungsten were found when tungsten powder or alloy pieces were exposed to aqueous solutions. The dissolution occurs along depletion in solution pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. Depending upon the alloying elements present, the final dissolved tungsten concentration varied from 70 to 475 mg/L. Reduction in pH, dissolved oxygen depletion, and high levels of dissolved tungsten may be of relevance to environmental forensics. In the presence of alloying elements such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, tungsten strongly sorbed to well-characterized model soils. Sorption of tungsten to illite and montmorillonite clays occurs with an increase in pH and appears to be nonreversible. This behavior may significantly retard tungsten mobility. The mixing of tungsten powder with soils at rates higher than 3{\%} (w/w) resulted in acidification of the soil matrix and had a significant impact on soil microbial community as determined by soil respiration.},

A preconcentration step via adsorption of the analytes onto activated charcoal is mandatory in analysis by ICP-AES in order to achieve practical detection limits of 1.2 $\mu$g L-1 for W and 0.4 $\mu$g L-1 for Mo. This step is also necessary in analysis by ICP-MS for waters high in total dissolved salts ({\textgreater} 1000 mg L-1). Application of this procedure results in detection limits of 0.06 $\mu$g L-1 for both elements, based on a 100-mL sample volume. The elements were found to be stable in solution in a variety of aqueous environments for a 32-day period. Analysis of the seawater reference material, NASS-1, and of spiked seawater samples, was performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed procedure to problematic aqueous matrices. The above methods were applied to 41 samples of waters taken from thermal, cold and iron-rich springs in the South Nahanni River area. Four distinctly anomalous sites ({\textgreater} 15 $\mu$g L-1 W) are hot springs spatially associated with Cretaceous granites, and three of these are in the vicinity of known scheelite-bearing skarns or wolframite occurrences. The remainder of the sites, located in folded and faulted sedimentary rocks as well as granites, produced waters with W and Mo abundances at or below detection limits. Determination of W and Mo in spring waters might be a useful adjunct to other exploration geochemical techniques as a means of identifying prospective areas. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Background. Sixteen children diagnosed with acute leukemia between 1997 and 2002 lived in Churchill County, Nevada, at the time of or before their illness. Considering the county population and statewide cancer rate, fewer than two cases would be expected. Objectives. In March 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led federal, state, and local agencies in a cross-sectional, case-comparison study to determine if ongoing environmental exposures posed a health risk to residents and to compare levels of contaminants in environmental and biologic samples collected from participating families. Methods. Surveys with more than 500 variables were administered to 205 people in 69 families. Blood, urine, and cheek cell samples were collected and analyzed for 139 chemicals, eight viral markers, and several genetic polymorphisms. Air, water, soil, and dust samples were collected from almost 80 homes to measure more than 200 chemicals. Results. The scope of this cancer cluster investigation exceeded any previous study of pediatric leukemia. Nonetheless, no exposure consistent with leukemia risk was identified. Overall, tungsten and arsenic levels in urine and water samples were significantly higher than national comparison values; however, levels were similar among case and comparison groups. Conclusions. Although the cases in this cancer cluster may in fact have a common etiology, their small number and the length of time between diagnosis and our exposure assessment lessen the ability to find an association between leukemia and environmental exposures. Given the limitations of individual cancer cluster investigations, it may prove more efficient to pool laboratory and questionnaire data from similar leukemia clusters.},

abstract = {Bismuth(III)-based materials are uniquely suited for in situ subsurface remedy applications, as they offer many beneficial properties, including high affinity for multiple contaminants, low human and environmental toxicity, low cost, and synthetic availability. This review summarizes the current research trends in targeted development of bismuth materials potentially useful for subsurface remedy applications, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding of relevant structure-property relationships. While various bismuth mineral phases can provide frameworks for contaminant sequestration, layered crystalline arrangements are particularly promising because of their electronic and spatial flexibility and their ability to accommodate a wide range of negatively charged species. This translates into a high uptake capacity for several recalcitrant colocated contaminants found at legacy nuclear processing sites, including technetium-99, iodine-129, hexavalent chromium (chromate), and uranium, and offers the potential for both in situ and ex situ remediation applications. Layered bismuth minerals are found in nature, and knowledge of their structure informs the targeted design and cost-effective synthesis of the structurally preorganized materials from readily available bismuth sources for remedial applications in soil and groundwater. This comprehensive review highlights the structure, synthesis, and environmental chemistry of Bi-based materials, including the interaction between Bi-based materials and key environmental contaminants, to explore their potential use for remediation. Bismuth oxyhydroxides, containing clusters of [Bi6O4(OH)4]6+and [Bi6O5(OH)3]5+surrounded by easily exchangeable anions such as nitrate, are versatile and show the greatest potential for environmental remediation applications. Because of their flexible structural arrangement, they have been shown to sequester electronically and sterically different anionic species, including chromate, pertechnetate, iodate, and uranyl carbonate, even when they are present as comingled contaminants in groundwater and pore water containing other competing anions (e.g., nitrate and carbonate) and in contact with subsurface sediments.},

The effect of contact time and EDTA concentration were evaluated for both individual soil fractions and synthetic soils. The extraction reached equilibrium rapidly, after about 30 min. A 0.01 M EDTA solution was less effective than a 0.05 M or a 0.10 M EDTA. EDTA was proved to be effective for metal removal from the four individual soil fractions and synthetic soils. In general, approximately 90{\%} of metals were removed from synthetic soils by 0.10 M EDTA. EDTA extraction of Pb from a contaminated carbonate fraction was thought to be affected by the formation of lead carbonates. A simple equation based on the sum of the released heavy metal from the individual components is used to check if there are interactions among the different soil components when mixed.

Root zone soil and rice plants were sampled at 15 sites in the agricultural field adjacent to W mines and analyzed for Al, Fe, Mn, Sc, and W contents and W chemical forms in the soil samples and W contents in the rice root, stem, leaf, and grain samples. Results showed that W content in the soil ranged from 3.99 to 43.7 mg kg−1, with more than 90{\%} of W in the residual fraction, showing its low mobility and bioavailability. Average W contents in the rice root, stem, leaf, and grain were 7.06, 2.34, 4.76, 0.17 mg kg−1, respectively. In addition, they were linearly independent of W content and chemical forms in the soil. Average enrichment factor values were 0.39, 0.13, 0.28, and 0.01 for the root, stem, leaf, and grain, respectively. In can be concluded that W mining activity in the Dayu county contaminated the nearby agricultural soil and led to W bioaccumulation in the rice. This may pose a health risk to residents via food and soil ingestion, which should be a focus of scrutiny.},

The procedure was evaluated by using a certified reference material, BCR-701. The results of the partitioning study indicate that more easily mobilised forms (acid exchangeable) were predominant for Cd and Zn, particularly in the sample from Cartagena. In contrast, the largest amount of lead was associated with the iron and manganese oxide fractions. On the other hand, the applicability of lixiviation tests commonly used to evaluate the leaching of toxic species from landfill disposal (US-EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure and DIN 38414-S4) to mining wastes was also investigated and the obtained results compared with the information on metal mobility derivable from the application of the three-stage sequential extraction procedure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In soil environments, sorption/desorption reactions as well as chemical complexation with inorganic and organic ligands and redox reactions, both biotic and abiotic, are of great importance in controlling their bioavailability, leaching and toxicity. These reactions are affected by many factors such as pH, nature of the sorbents, presence and concentration of organic and inorganic ligands, including humic and fulvic acid, root exudates, microbial metabolites and nutrients. In this review, we highlight the impact of physical, chemical, and biological interfacial interactions on bioavailability and mobility of metals and metalloids in soil. Special attention is devoted to: i) the sorption/desorption processes of metals and metalloids on/from soil components and soils; ii) their precipitation and reduction-oxidation reactions in solution and onto surfaces of soil components; iii) their chemical speciation, fractionation and bioavailability.},

abstract = {In order to limit the dispersive use of lead on small arms firing ranges, 5.56-mm bullets with tungsten-nylon composite material cores have been fired at a number of Army training ranges. Tungsten in bullet residues oxidizes when exposed to the atmosphere, yielding an amorphous tungsten oxide (WO 3) coating. This coating rapidly dissolves to yield the tungstate anion (WO 4 2-), which can migrate in saturated subsurface and surface water environments. The environmental geochemistry of dissolved tungsten species is complex, and consequently is not well characterized. Tungsten exists in most environmental matrices as the soluble and mobile tungstate anion, which can polymerize with itself and other anions, such as molybdate and phosphate, making determination of tungsten compounds important. Since the geochemical and toxicological properties of these polymer species may vary from monomeric tungstate, determination of tungstate is as critical as determination of total dissolved tungsten concentration. High performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) has been used to determine tungsten speciation. Specifically, ion exchange chromatographic separations have been employed in investigations of tungsten leached from soil that was aged after amendment with metallic tungsten powder. Deionized water extraction of soil materials with HPLC-ICP-MS separation and detection indicated that up to approximately half of the extracted tungsten was in the form of polymers. Over 15 mg/L of soluble tungsten was measured in the extraction solution of soil aged for approximately 6 months. Further characterization experiments are in progress to elucidate the geochemical properties of the polymer species.},

abstract = {Zinc (Zn) is ubiquitous in the environment, occurring on the Earth's crust at an average concentration of about 70 mg/kg (Lindsay and Norvell 1978, Lindsay 1979). Zinc metal is very rarely found in nature, requiring extreme reducing conditions to exist. Rather, Zn typically occurs in the +2 oxidation state, primarily as various geogenic minerals such as sphalerite (zinc sulfide), smithsonite (zinc carbonate), zincite (zinc oxide), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), and willemeite (zinc silicate) (Lindsay 1979, Van Damme 2010, Jacquat 2011). Sorption is the dominant reaction mechanism governing fate and transport of zinc in soil and sediment environments at or just below circumneutral pH (Puls and Bohn 1988, Hesterberg et al. 1997a, Elzinga et al. 1999, Smolders et al. 2004, Grafe and Sparks 2005). In higher pH environments, zinc can partition as solid-phase precipitates, independently or on the surfaces of minerals, and is less soluble than sorption complexes (Roberts et al. 2003, Nachtegaal et al. 2005, Panfili et al. 2005). Remediation efforts to Zn contaminated soils have demonstrated that in situ amendments and pH adjustments can alter the chemistry of zinc to less extractable and bioavailable forms (Agbenin 1998, Mench et al. 2000, Basta et al. 2001, Zwonitzer et al. 2003, Brown et al. 2004, Nachtegaal et al. 2005, Williams et al. 2011).},

Given the proximity of residential communities to these mining residues, we investigated samples of mine waste (n = 5), urban soil (n = 6), and road dust (n = 5) with a special focus on the solid speciation of As, Cu, Pb, and Zn using a combination of methods (XRD, SEM/EDS, oxalate extractions), as well as on in vitro bioaccessibility in simulated gastric and lung fluids to assess the potential exposure risks for humans. Bulk chemical analyses indicated that As is the most important contaminant in the mine wastes ({\~{}}1.15 wt{\%}), urban soils ({\~{}}2900 mg/kg) and road dusts ({\~{}}440 mg/kg). Bioaccessible fractions of As were quite low (4–13{\%}) in both the simulated gastric and lung fluids, while the bioaccessibility of metals ranged between {\textless}0.01{\%} (Pb) and 68{\%} (Zn). The bioaccessibilities of the metal(loid)s were dependent on the mineralogy and different adsorption properties of the metal(loid)s. Based on our results, a potential health risk, especially for children, was recognized from the ingestion of mine waste materials and highly contaminated urban soil. Based on the risk assessment, arsenic was found to be the element posing the greatest risk.},

abstract = {Colloidal iron(III) oxyhydroxides (FeOx) are important reactive adsorbents in nature. This study was set up to determine the size of environmentally relevant FeOx colloids with new methods, i.e. Flow Field Flow Fractionation (FlFFF-UV-ICP-MS) and single-particle ICP-MS/MS (sp-ICP-MS) and to compare these with standard approaches, i.e. dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), microscopy (TEM), membrane filtration, centrifugation and dialysis. Seven synthetic nano- and submicron FeOx with different mineralogy and coating were prepared and two soil solutions were included. The FlFFF was optimized for Fe recovery, yielding 70–90{\%}. The FlFFF determines particle size with high resolution in a 1 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.3) background and can detect Fe-NOM complexes {\textless}5 nm and organo-mineral FeOx particles ranging 5–300 nm. The sp-ICP-MS method had a size detection limit for FeOx of about 32–47 nm. The distribution of hydrodynamic diameters of goethite particles detected with FlFFF, NTA and DLS were similar but the values were twice as large as the Fe cores of particles detected with sp-ICP-MS and TEM. Conventional fractionation by centrifugation and dialysis generally yielded similar fractions as FlFFF but membrane filtration overestimated the large size fractions. Particles formed from Fe(II) oxidation in the presence of NOM showed strikingly smaller organo-mineral Fe-Ox colloids as the NOM/Fe ratio increased. The soil solution obtained with centrifugation of an acid peat was dominated by small ({\textless}30 nm) Fe-OM complexes and organo-mineral FeOx colloids whereas that of a mineral pH neutral soil mainly contains larger (30–200 nm) Fe-rich particles. The FlFFF-UV-ICP-MS is recommended for environmental studies of colloidal FeOx since it has a wide size detection range, it fractionates in an environmentally relevant background (1 mM NH4HCO3) and it has acceptable element recoveries.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss the use of variations in the oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of hydrous silicates to paleoaltimetry studies. Currently, there are numerous isotopie (lacustrine, palustrine, and pedogenic carbonates, hydrous silicates, fluid inclusions) and paleofloral (leaf physiognomy, stornata density) proxies that provide information on climatic and topographic histories of mountain belts. Compared to lacustrine and paleosoil carbonates that frequently provide detailed and temporally extensive paleoaltimetric records, the use of hydrous silicates (such as smectite, kaolinite, chert, as well as metamorphic minerals that grow in the presence of meteoric waters) in paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies has important additional advantages. First, hydrous silicates provide both a hydrogen and oxygen isotope record. These two isotope systems can be used to evaluate climate change, but are also useful in understanding evaporative effects on meteoric waters prior to mineral formation. Since evaporation can cause isotopie changes that otherwise would correspond to changes on the order of kilometers of surface uplift, it is critical in any isotopie paleoaltimetry study within continental interiors to examine both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope record. Second, hydrogen isotope ratios of micas in deep-seated extensional shear zones often reflect the composition of meteoric waters that infiltrated these rocks during the late stages of orogenesis. As such, it is possible to use the combined oxygen, hydrogen and geochronological record of synkinematic micas in extensional shear zones as a paleoaltimeter. This information when combined with high-precision geochronology and paleoaltimetry studies of intermontane basins formed above these shear zones allows for the development of an integrated structural, sedimentologie, and surface elevation history of an evolving orogen.},

abstract = {This paper reports a comparative study of the concentration of three important environmental elements that are often found together in mineral deposits and then associated with mining activities; copper, arsenic and antimony. These elements were determined in 26 different agricultural soils from regions I, II and V in Chile, zones where the most important and biggest copper industries of this country are located. As background levels of these elements in soils have not been well established in this study, both, impacted and non-impacted agricultural soils from different regions were considered. The relationships between the concentrations of these elements in soils were also examined. The concentration ranges for copper, arsenic and antimony were 11-530; 2.7-202 and 0.42-11 mg kg-1 respectively. The copper concentrations in non-polluted soils from the north and central zone of Chile were similar. However, three sites from the north region have copper concentration as higher as 100 mg kg-1, values that exceed the critical concentration for copper in soils. The concentration of arsenic and antimony in the north soils were higher than in non-impacted ones and, in the case of arsenic, greatly exceeded the world average concentration reported for this element in soils. The highest arsenic and antimony concentrations were found in Calama and Quillagua soils, two different sites in the Loa valley. The arsenic/antimony concentration ratio was higher in Quillagua soil. The high concentrations of three elements determined in impacted soils from region V (Puchuncavi and Catemu valleys) clearly shows the impact produced in this zone by the industrial and mining activities developed in their proximities. At Puchuncav{\'{i}} valley a clear decrease was observed in copper, arsenic and antimony concentrations in soils on the function of the distance from the industrial complex "Las Ventanas", and all concentrations exceeded the reported critical values for this matrix. Instead at Catemu valley, only the copper concentration was higher than this value. Statistically significant correlation was found for Cu-Sb in all soils; more significant Cu-As, Cu-Sb and Sb-As correlations were evaluated for soils from Puchuncavi and Catemu valleys, corroborating that high concentrations of copper, arsenic and antimony in these soils coming from the same pollution sources, the copper industry and the therḿoelectric power plant.},

Selective extractions were obtained for As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in metal- coprecipitated phases whereas NH2OH-HCl was not selective for the extraction of Hg and Cd coprecipitated in hausmannite and amorphous iron oxide, respectively. Otherwise, Cd, Hg, Ni and Zn sorbed on the different phases were released with MgCl2 and NaOAc/HOAc, but stronger reagents were needed to release As, Cr, Cu and Pb. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Groundwater samples were collected along flow paths within the Carrizo Sand aquifer (southeastern Texas) and the Aquia aquifer (coastal Maryland) for analysis of dissolved tungsten (W) concentrations, along with the major solutes, pH, and measures of in situ redox conditions [e.g., dissolved Fe(II), Fe(III), and S(-II) concentrations]. In addition, sediment samples were collected from both aquifers to evaluate the solid-phase speciation of W. Tungsten concentrations in the Carrizo Sand aquifer range from 3.64 to 1297pmolkg-1 (mean±SD=248±440pmolkg-1), with the lowest concentrations reported from the recharge area. Tungsten concentrations progressively increase down gradient along the flow path within Carrizo Sand aquifer groundwaters, reaching the highest levels in sulfidic groundwater roughly 50-60km from the recharge zone. Tungsten is strongly correlated with pH and dissolved sulfide [i.e., S(-II)] concentrations in Carrizo groundwaters (r=0.78 and 0.95, respectively). In Aquia aquifer groundwaters W concentrations range between 14.3 and 184.4pmolkg-1 (mean±SD=63.9±59pmolkg-1), and exhibit no, or at best, weak relationships with other geochemical parameters measured along the flow path (e.g., r=0.4 and 0.08 for W vs. pH and S(-II), respectively). The data suggest that the increase in W concentrations in Carrizo groundwaters reflects, in part, pH-related adsorption/desorption, which has been shown to be substantial for groundwaters and lake waters with pH{\textgreater}8. Owing to the similar chemical properties of W and Mo, which form thiomolybdates in sulfidic waters, the formation of thiotungstate complexes may also be important in the sulfidic waters of the Carrizo aquifer. The substantially lower W concentrations in Aquia aquifer groundwaters reflect the fact that the maximum groundwater pH never exceeds 8.4 (mean±SD pH=7.97±0.23), dissolved low S(-II) concentrations remain low (mean±SD S(-II)=0.29±0.16$\mu$molkg-1), and that Aquia aquifer sediments have substantially higher Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide contents compared to the Carrizo Sand aquifer. Our data indicate that pH-related adsorption/desorption reactions and the Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide content of aquifer sediments are key controls affecting W concentrations in oxic, suboxic, and anoxic groundwaters, and, further, that the formation of thiotungstate species may also be important in some anoxic (i.e., sulfidic) waters. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Paleoaltimetric studies have characterized in detail the relationship between carbonate oxygen isotope ratios ($\delta$18Oc) and elevation in orogens with simple, single-moisture-source hydrological systems, and applied this relationship to ancient continental carbonates to provide constraints on their past elevation. However, mixing of different atmospheric moisture sources in low-elevation orogens should affect $\delta$18Oc values, but this effect has not yet been confirmed unequivocally. In the American Southwest, summer monsoonal moisture, sourced in the Equatorial Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, and winter moisture, sourced in the East Pacific, both contribute to annual rainfall. We present stable isotope results from Quaternary carbonates within the American Southwest to characterize the regional $\delta$18Oc-elevation relationship. We then provide stable isotope results from local Eocene carbonates to reconstruct late Laramide paleoelevations. The Quaternary $\delta$18Oc-elevation relationship in the American Southwest is not as straightforward as in more simple hydrological systems. $\delta$18Oc changes with altitude are non-linear, scattered, and display an apparent isotopic lapse rate inversion above 1200 m of elevation. We speculate that decreasing surface temperatures at high altitudes limit the duration of carbonate growth to the summer months, biasing $\delta$18Oc values toward higher values typical of the summer monsoon and leading to lapse rate inversion. $\delta$18Oc-elevation relationships based on modern water isotope data or distillation models predict paleoelevations that range up to as much as 2 km higher than the modern elevations of 2000 to 2400 m for our late Eocene sites located at the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. By contrast, our $\delta$18Oc-elevation relationship for the American Southwest yields lower paleoelevation estimates. These alternate estimates nonetheless suggest that significant elevation (at least $\delta$1 km) had already been attained by the Eocene, but are also compatible with {\textless} 1 km of uplift by post-Laramide mechanisms. Our results show the limitations of standard $\delta$18Oc-elevation models in complex hydrological systems and suggest that similar mechanisms may have led to summer-biased paleoaltimetry estimates for the initial stages of other orogenies -in the American Southwest and elsewhere.},

For the latter, iron (hydr)oxides are the most important sinks for pollutants, and recently, their surface reactivity was the focus of many research works. In this work, we develop a joint approach, using in situ infrared spectroscopy and DFT simulations, to characterize the Mo(VI) and W(VI) species adsorbed on hematite ($\alpha$-Fe2O3). Surface sorbed polymers of tungstate and molybdate on hematite were identified for low pH and at high concentration of these elements, which is similar to the formation of polyoxometalates in solution phase. However, the surface speciation is different from the adsorption of polymolybdate or polytungstate already formed in solution and should be consistent with the growth of a surface polymer. For low concentrations/high pH conditions, the spectra are consistent with a monodentate surface complexation.},

This activity has resulted in waste rock and tailings being dispersed from the mine workings down to a large tailings dump and then along a river valley eventually reaching the sea. This tailings dump material consists of a variety of ferruginous materials that often contain trace elements that are environmentally harmful and possibly toxic. These ferruginous materials have distinctive spectral features which make them amenable to detection, and mapping by airborne imaging spectrometer data. The dispersion of the tailings material was studied using two semiquantitative techniques, matched filtering and linear spectral unmixing and qualitative methods using band ratios and the variation in strength of spectral features. The distinct ferruginous mineral phases resolved by these methods were then compared to laboratory reference spectrum using qualitative analysis of the spectral profiles and two quantitative techniques, spectral angle mapping and cross correlogram spectral matching. The distribution of the ferruginous materials identified from the imaging spectrometer data supports the results of laboratory experiments on the dependence of the formation of iron species on their geochemical and physical situation.},

Aqua regia extraction and subsequent analysis of spoil and vegetation confirmed the presence of tungsten and other heavy metals. Spoil samples examined were last worked almost 100 years ago and the concentrations of copper, zinc, tungsten and arsenic detected demonstrate the environmental persistence of these metals in an area of relatively high rainfall. The bioaccumulation of tungsten by two species of plants is indicated and partitioning within different tissues of Calluna vulgaris is demonstrated. Mechanisms relating to mobility and speciation of the metals present were explored using sequential and single stage extraction systems.

abstract = {The increasing use of tungsten in the production of green energy in the aerospace and military industries, and in many other hi-tech applications, may increase the content of this element in soil. This overview examines some aspects of the behavior of tungsten in soil, such as the importance of characteristics of soils in relation to bioavailability processes, the chemical approaches to evaluate tungsten mobility in the soil environment and the importance of adsorption and desorption processes. Tungsten behavior depends on soil properties of which the most important is soil pH, which determines the solubility and polymerization of tungstate ions and the characteristics of the adsorbing soil surfaces. During the adsorption and desorption of tungsten, iron, and aluminum oxides, and hydroxides play a key role as they are the most important adsorbing surfaces for tungsten. The behavior of tungsten compounds in the soil determines the transfer of this element in plants and therefore in the food chain. Despite the growing importance of tungsten in everyday life, environmental regulations concerning soil do not take this element into consideration. The purpose of this review is also to provide some basic information that could be useful when considering tungsten in environmental legislation.},

abstract = {A major decline in marine methanogen populations during the Late Archaean Eon has been proposed as a driver for the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at {\~{}}2.4Ga. Konhauser et al. (2009, Nature 458, 750-753) recently hypothesized that a dramatic decrease between 2.7 and 2.4Ga in the concentration of dissolved Ni, an essential nutrient for methanogens, may have been responsible for the decline. To test that hypothesis, Ni stable isotopes, a novel proxy for methanogen Ni limitation, will be applied to the Late Archaean-Paleoproterozoic rock record in the future, possibly through analysis of banded iron formations (BIFs). In order to facilitate interpretation of those data, we investigated the fractionation of Ni stable isotopes during sorption to synthetic ferrihydrite, which was likely the primary precipitating phase during BIF deposition, via bench-top experiments. The observed fractionations for adsorption and coprecipitation experiments were indistinguishable and averaged $\delta$60/58Nidissolved-sorbed=+0.35±0.10‰ (1 sd; light Ni sorbed). Parallel, linear trends in isotope compositions of dissolved and sorbed Ni as a function of fraction of Ni sorbed indicate an equilibrium isotope effect with rapid and continuous exchange between dissolved and sorbed Ni. Additionally, we observed fractionation of $\delta$60/58Nidissolved-sorbed=+0.23±0.07‰ (1 sd) in experiments in which ferrihydrite had been aged for up to 30days and had partially transformed to goethite and hematite; thus the fractionations in all of our experiments are the same within uncertainties. Although our simple system differs from Archaean seawater, our results suggest that ferrihydrite precipitating to form BIFs may always have been offset by a constant fractionation from coexisting dissolved Ni in seawater.},

Disruption of longitudinal, lateral, and vertical hydrological connectivity through intermittence explains many of the differences in the physicochemistry between IRES and perennial systems. Physicochemical conditions affect the structure and functioning of all aquatic ecosystems; however, because of the greater variability (e.g., substantial daily, seasonal, and supraseasonal variation in parameters like dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH) in IRES compared to perennial systems, changes in the physicochemistry are particularly important in defining the ecological conditions of IRES. IRES are especially vulnerable to anthropogenic inputs because their low water volume during flow cessation limits their dilution capacity. Understanding the processes responsible for the natural temporal and spatial variability in the physicochemistry in IRES informs the design and implementation of effective conservation and management plans in IRES.},

Historical skarn tailings at Yxsj{\"{o}}berg, Sweden, containing e.g. Be, Bi, Cu, F, Sn, S, W, and Zn were geochemically characterized as a first step to evaluate the environmental impact and the potential to re-mine the tailings. The tailings were deposited between 1897 and 1963 in the Smaltj{\"{a}}rnen Repository without dams or a complete cover, and have been in contact with the atmosphere for {\textgreater}30 years. Four vertical cores throughout the tailings were taken and divided into 134 subsamples, which were analyzed for total concentrations and paste pH. Selected samples from different depths were mineralogically characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Minerals, hand-picked from drilled rock cores, were analyzed for the element content, and a modified Element to Mineral Conversion (EMC) that pinpoints the quantitative distribution of elements between the minerals in the tailings was carried out. The average concentrations of Be, Bi, Cu, Sn, Zn, W, F and S in the tailings were 284, 495, 946, 559, 301, and 960 ppm, and 1.9 and 1.2 wt{\%}, respectively. The tailings has reached a late stage development due to pyrrhotite oxidation resulting in low pH ({\textless}4) in the uppermost tailings, and formations of secondary minerals such as gypsum, hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) and orthogonal calcite. Secondary pyrite and magnetite, formed from monoclinic pyrrhotite was detected, and different weathering rates of secondary pyrite, hexagonal and monoclinic pyrrhotite was indicated, with secondary pyrite as the most stable and monoclinic pyrrhotite as the least. The rare and easily-weathered mineral danalite (Fe4Be3(SiO4)3S) was found in the drilled rock cores and by XRD in the tailings. However, the mineral could not be found by optical microscopy or SEM-EDS. This suggests that the mineral has been weathered to a great extent, which poses a high risk of releasing elements of potential concern to the groundwater since danalite contains approximately 40{\%} of the total Be and Zn concentrations in the tailings. Fluorine was mainly found in fluorite, Cu in chalcopyrite, and Bi in bismuthinite; which all showed signs of weathering in acidic condition in the uppermost part, subsequent with decreased concentrations, followed by accumulation peaks deeper down in the tailings correlated with Al. Tungsten was mainly found in scheelite; most grains were unweathered, but a few grains had altered rims or HFO on the mineral surfaces. Tin was mainly found in ferrohornblende, hedenbergite and grossular. Beryllium, Cu, F, and Zn has high potential to be released to the surrounding environment from the Smaltj{\"{a}}rnen Repository, while W, Bi and Sn are relatively stable in the tailings. Most of the scheelite is intact and re-mining could, therefore, be a suitable remediation method that would both reduce the environmental impact and simultaneously support the supply of critical raw materials in the EU.},

abstract = {In intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (hereafter, IRES), hydrological connectivity mediated by either flowing or nonflowing water extends along three spatial dimensions-longitudinal, lateral, and vertical-and varies over time. Flow intermittence disrupts this connectivity, operating through complex hydrological transitions (e.g., between flowing and nonflowing phases). These transitions occur concurrently and interact along all three spatial dimensions, primarily driven by flow regime and catchment geomorphology, modified by human activities. Longitudinally, streamflow cessation and drying interrupt hydrological connectivity, contributing to physicochemical patchiness, habitat isolation, and fragmentation of metapopulations and metacommunities. Laterally, hydrological connectivity established during overbank flows is lost when water levels fall, reducing water-mediated transfers of energy, materials, and organisms from the floodplain and riparian zone. Vertically, flow cessation impairs exchange of surface and shallow groundwater, severely altering hydrological, chemical, and microbial gradients within the sediments. Concurrent interactions and physical discontinuities in hydrological connectivity along these three dimensions produce complex mosaics of physicochemical patches at different scales whose boundaries fluctuate over time in response to the flow regime. This complex patchiness underpins the characteristic physical, chemical, and biological diversity at multiple scales along longitudinal, lateral, and vertical hydrological dimensions in IRES.},

abstract = {The similar, but not identical chemical properties of W compared with Mo suggest that the stable isotope system of W could be a novel proxy to explore the modern and ancient ocean as is the case in the well-established utility of Mo isotopes. We experimentally investigated the isotopic fractionation of W during adsorption on Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides (ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2), a key process in the global ocean budget of this element. Our adsorption experiments confirmed that W isotopes fractionate substantially on both ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2: lighter W isotopes are preferentially adsorbed on both oxides as a result of equilibrium isotopic exchange between dissolved and adsorbed species, and the obtained values of $\Delta$186/183Wliquid–solid ( = $\delta$186Wdissolved − $\delta$186Wadsorbed) are 0.76 ± 0.09‰ for ferrihydrite and 0.88 ± 0.21‰ for $\delta$-MnO2 (2$\sigma$, n = 6). Compared with the case of Mo isotopes, fractionation of W isotopes is (i) of comparable magnitude between ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2, and (ii) much smaller than that of Mo on $\delta$-MnO2. Our previous XAFS observations and newly-performed DFT calculations both indicate that the observed W isotopic fractionations are caused by the symmetry change from Td (tetrahedral) WO42− to distorted Oh (octahedral) monomeric W species via formation of inner-sphere complexes on both ferrihydrite and $\delta$-MnO2. The similar isotopic fractionations between the two oxides relate to the strong tendency for W to form inner-sphere complexes, which causes the symmetry change, in contrast to the outer-sphere complex of Mo on ferrihydrite. The smaller isotopic fractionation of W compared with Mo on $\delta$-MnO2 despite their similar molecular symmetry seems to be due to their different degrees of distortion of Oh species. Our findings imply that the isotopic composition of W in modern oxic seawater is likely to become heavier relative to the input by removal of lighter W isotopes via adsorption on ferromanganese oxides in analogy with the Mo isotope budget. In contrast, the isotopic composition of W in ancient seawater should have evolved in response to the extent of deposition of both Fe and Mn oxides; this is likely to be different compared with that of the Mo isotopes, which is strongly associated with the occurrence of Mn oxides relative to Fe oxides.},

abstract = {Tungsten (W) is commonly employed as a non-toxic alternative to lead in a broad variety of industrial and military applications. However, correlations between environmental contamination through soil, water and airborne pathways, and biological effects such as epithelial damage, bioaccumulation, and trophic mobility, have led to its classification as an “emerging contaminant.” Of particular concern are recent clusters of childhood leukemia and lung cancer in the vicinity of tungsten mines and processing facilities. High environmental tungsten availability has also been associated with altered thyroid function, cardiovascular disease, and prolonged elevation of concentrations in blood, breath, and urine. Tungsten's use as a replacement for lead (Pb) in military munitions has resulted in leaching of tungsten into soil and into soft tissues in which bullet fragments are embedded. Despite these associations, no consensus has been reached regarding the mechanisms by which tungsten affects the human body. Particularly confounding are the issues of co-toxicity with other known contaminants such as arsenic, cobalt, and cadmium, and differences resulting from the various methods of ingestion. The present paper summarizes the current behavior of tungsten in the environment, its occurrence within the pedosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere, and discusses its potential effects on exposed biota (especially humans). In particular, knowledge gaps are identified regarding the biological mechanisms of tungsten-related disease, which urgently require further elucidation in order to develop appropriate policies and management practices for the use of this element.},

abstract = {Risk assessment of contaminants requires simple, meaningful tools to obtain information on contaminant pools of differential lability and bioavailability in the soil. We developed and tested a sequential extraction procedure (SEP) for As by choosing extraction reagents commonly used for sequential extraction of metals, Se and P. Tests with alternative extractants that have been used in SEPs for P and metals, including NH4NO3, NaOAc, NH2OH{\textperiodcentered}HCl, EDTA, NH4OH and NH4F, were shown to either have only low extraction efficiency for As, or to be insufficiently selective or specific for the phases targeted. The final sequence obtained includes the following five extraction steps: (1) 0.05M (NH4)2SO4, 20°C/4h; (2) 0.05M NH4H2PO4, 20°C/16h; (3) 0.2M NH4+-oxalate buffer in the dark, pH 3.25, 20°C/4h; (4) 0.2M NH4+-oxalate buffer+ascorbic acid, pH 3.25, 96°C/0.5h; (5) HNO3/H2O2 microwave digestion. Within the inherent limitations of chemical fractionation, these As fractions appear to be primarily associated with (1) non-specifically sorbed; (2) specifically-sorbed; (3) amorphous and poorly-crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe and Al; (4) well-crystallized hydrous oxides of Fe and Al; and (5) residual phases. This interpretation is supported by selectivity and specificity tests on soils and pure mineral phases, and by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXMA) of As in selected soils. Partitioning of As among these five fractions in 20 soils was ({\%}, medians and ranges): (1) 0.24 (0.02-3.8); (2) 9.5 (2.6-25); (3) 42.3 (12-73); (4) 29.2 (13-39); and (5) 17.5 (1.1-38). The modified SEP is easily adaptable in routine soil analysis, is dependable as indicated by repeatability (w≥0.98) and recovery tests. This SEP can be useful in predicting the changes in the lability of As in various solid phases as a result of soil remediation or alteration in environmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Temporary rivers are characterized by shifting habitats between flowing, isolated pools, and dry phases. Despite the fact that temporary rivers are currently receiving increasing attention by researchers and managers, the isolated pools phase has been largely disregarded. However, isolated pools in temporary rivers are transitional habitats of major ecological relevance as they support aquatic ecosystems during no-flow periods, and can act as refugees for maintaining local and regional freshwater biodiversity. Pool characteristics such as surface water permanence and size, presence of predators, local physicochemical conditions, time since disconnection from the river flow, or distance to other freshwater habitats challenge a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of these habitats, and challenge ecological quality assessments and conservation practices in temporary rivers. In this paper, we aim at providing a characterization of isolated pools from a hydrological, geomorphological, physicochemical, biogeochemical, and biological point of view as a framework to better conceptualize, conserve, and manage these habitats.},

abstract = {Two sequential extraction procedures including Tessier and Wenzel schemes have been evaluated for the study of tungsten fractionation in soil samples adjacent to the World's largest and longest-operating tungsten mines in China. The efficiency and suitability of two methods and the corresponding extraction steps for partitioning tungsten were compared. Results showed the Tessier scheme classical for cation metals was inappropriate for tungsten fractionation. Although the percentage of readily bioavailable tungsten fractions extracted by the Tessier method is comparable to the Wenzel method, the Tessier scheme still has some drawbacks for partitioning tungsten mainly arising from the lack of selectivity of some of the reagents used. The Wenzel scheme has higher extraction recovery and efficiency than the Tessier method, especially for extracting amorphous and crystalline oxyhydroxides which were mainly responsible for tungsten retention. As a final conclusion, the study indicated that the Wenzel scheme should be more suitable for tungsten fractionation, but we need to make further improvement on the Wenzel scheme by supplementing the extraction stage for the oxidisable fraction to find a reliable and easy to use method to characterize tungsten forms in all soil samples to provide valuable information for risk assessment.},

abstract = {Two industrial by products, red mud (RM) and aluminum-rich water treatment residue (Al-WTR) were used (2{\%}w/w) for the immobilization of As, Cu and Pb in two polluted soils. Soil-1 was a mine contaminated soil (2428 As, 234 Cu and 559 Pbmgkg-1); Soil-2 was a chromated copper arsenate contaminated soil (860 and 1500mgkg-1 of As and Cu respectively). Two different redox conditions (aerobic and 3 repeated reduction/oxidation cycles) were also applied. The immobilization of trace elements and their bioaccessibility were evaluated through a leaching test and simplified bioaccessibility extraction test (SBRC) respectively, whereas phytoavailability was assessed in pot trials with Lolium perenne.The RM addition increased the solubility of As and Pb, under both redox conditions, in Soil-1 with respect to untreated soil (i.e., +40 and 38{\%} respectively in RMsw-Soil-1 in aerobic condition). In Soil-2 Al-WTR was the amendment most efficient at decreasing As mobility ({\textless}50{\%} with respect to untreated soil). The high correlations detected between trace element mobility and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) suggests that As, Cu and Pb formed soluble organic complexes. The SBRC results suggested that this test was mainly affected by physical and chemical characteristics of soils, whereas trial pot showed that the treatments with RMsw and Al-WTR in aerobic condition were able to decrease the plant uptake of As by 34 and 57{\%} in Soil-1, and by 88 and 87{\%} in Soil-2. These treatments also reduced uptake of Cu from Soil-2 (by 68 and 86{\%}) and of Pb from Soil-1 (by 52 and 34{\%}).The results of this study show that the efficacy of the soil amendments is a complex function of soil conditions, source of contamination, and perhaps most importantly the environmental endpoint considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Imaging spectrometry, simultaneous measurement of spectra and images in up to hundreds of spectral channels or bands, is a proven technology for identifying and mapping minerals based on their reflectance or emissivity signatures. Also known as hyperspectral imaging or "HSI", extraction of key spectral signatures from these data allows direct identification of iron minerals such as hematite, goethite, and jarosite in the visible/near infrared (VNIR); clays, carbonates, micas, sulfates, and other minerals in the short wave infrared (SWIR); and silicates and carbonates in the long wave infrared (LWIR). The unique capability of imaging spectrometry to produce detailed maps of the spatial distribution of specific minerals, mineral assemblages, and mineral variability on the surface of Earth makes it an ideal tool for enhanced geomorphic mapping. Case histories illustrate the use of HSI for characterizing and mapping active and relict geothermal/hydrothermal systems and determining relations between mineralogy and derived landforms. Imaging spectrometry, used in conjunction with complimentary datasets such as InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), or stereo (photogrammetric-derived) digital elevation models (DEMs), provides a unique means of visualizing the spatial distribution and association of mineralogy with topography, thus contributing to the understanding of the relations between geology and landscape and to improved interpretation of surface geologic processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Instrumental mass bias effects and isotope fractionation during W separation are corrected for by means of a 180W-183W double-spike added prior to sample dissolution. The separation of W from the matrix is achieved via three-step anion-exchange chromatography. Tungsten stable isotopic compositions were determined by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). Results are expressed relative to the NIST SRM 3136 W standard as the permil difference in 186W/184W ($\delta$186W).

abstract = {Tungsten (W) occurrence and speciation was investigated in sediments collected from Fallon, Nevada where previous studies have linked elevated W levels in human body fluids to an unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases. The speciation of sedimentary W was determined by $\mu$-XRF mapping and $\mu$-XANES. The W content of the analyzed surface sediments ranged between 81 and 25,908 mg/kg, which is significantly higher than the W content in deeper sediments which ranged from 37 to 373 mg/kg at 30 cm depth. The $\mu$-XANES findings reveal that approximately 20–50{\%} of the total W in the shallow sediment occurs in the metallic form (W0); the rest occurs in the oxide form (WVIO3). Because W0 does not occur naturally, its elevated concentrations in surface sediments point toward a possible local anthropogenic origin. The oxidation of metallic W0 with meteoric waters likely leads to the formation of WVIO3. The chief water-soluble W species was identified as WO42− by chromatographic separation and speciation modeling. These results led us to postulate that W0 particles from a currently unknown but local source(s) is (are) deposited onto the soils and/or surface sediments. The W0 in interaction with meteoric water is oxidized to WVIO3, and as these sediment-water interactions progress, WO42− is formed in the water at pH ∼7. Under pH {\textless} 7, and sufficient W concentrations, tungstate tends to polymerize, and polymerized species are less likely to adsorb onto sediments. Polymerized species have lower affinity than monomers, which leads to enhanced mobility of W.},

The impacts of metal contamination on agriculture range from the agricultural soil to the produce in our food basket. The heavy metals (HMs) and metalloids, including Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sn, Hg, Pb, among others, can result in significant toxic impacts. The intensification of agricultural land use and changes in farming practices along with technological advancement have led to heavy metal pollution in soil. Metals/metalloids concentrations in the soil are increasing at alarming rate and affect plant growth, food safety, and soil microflora. The biological and geological reorganization of heavy metal depends chiefly on green plants and their metabolism. Metal toxicity has direct effects to flora that forms an integral component of ecosystems. Altered biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes are found in plants growing in regions of high metal pollution. However, metals like Cu, Mn, Co, Zn, and Cr are required in trace amounts by plants for their metabolic activities. The present review aims to catalog major published works related to heavy metal contamination in modern day agriculture, and draw a possible road map toward future research in this domain.},

Two hundred and thirty-nine freshwater sediments were collected from the Fei-Tsui Reservoir Watershed (FTRW) in northern Taiwan. Forty-two surface (0-15 cm) and subsurface (15-30 cm) soil samples were likewise collected from 21 representative arable soils derived from various parent materials and with varying weathered degrees in different regions of Taiwan. In addition, one hundred and ninety-four non-arable soils were collected from the different forest regions, industrial parks, resident areas, and commercial areas. Several digestion methods including the aqua regia and different combinations of concentrated acids (HClO4, HNO3, H2SO4, or HF) were compared. All samples were digested both by the aqua regia method and the Baker and Amacher method for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The Reisenauer method was used for Cr and the Burau method for Pb further. The results indicate that the best digestion methods to analyze the total contents of heavy metals in the sediments and soils were recommended as follows: the Baker and Amacher method for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn; the Reisenauer method for Cr, but for simplicity the Baker and Amacher method is also recommended as the flexible method for the total analysis of Cr; the aqua regia method for Cu, Ni, and Zn; and the Burau method for Pb.},

However, these factors have not been systematically examined for phases of the same composition with different levels of surface disorder. We present pH-dependent adsorption edges, X-ray absorption spectra, and isotopic measurements to illustrate the effects of surface structural disorder and surface coverage on zinc(II) (Zn(II)) surface complexation and isotope fractionation. Our results demonstrate that Zn(II) surface complexes on quartz and amorphous silica (SiO2(am)) transition from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination by oxygen as surface coverage increases. In low ionic strength solutions (I = 0.004 M) and at low surface loadings ($\Gamma$ {\textless} 0.6 $\mu$mol m−2), Zn(II) adsorbs to the quartz surface predominantly as outer-sphere octahedral complexes (RZn-O = 2.05 {\AA}) with no significant isotopic fractionation ($\Delta$66/64Znaqueous-sorbed = −0.01 ± 0.06‰) from aqueous Zn(II). In contrast, under similar chemical conditions and surface loading, outer-sphere Zn(II) adsorption complexes are not observed on SiO2(am) surfaces. At high ionic strength (I = 0.1 M) and low surface loading ($\Gamma$ {\textless} 0.2 $\mu$mol m−2), inner-sphere, monodentate octahedral Zn(II) complexes (RZn-O = 2.05–2.07 {\AA}) are observed on both quartz and SiO2(am) surfaces. At the same ionic strength (I = 0.1 M) and higher surface loading ($\Gamma$ = 0.6–1.4 $\mu$mol m−2), Zn(II) forms inner-sphere, monodentate tetrahedral complexes (RZn-O = 1.98 {\AA}) at the quartz surface. On the SiO2(am) surface under similar chemical conditions and surface loading, Zn(II) forms dominantly inner-sphere, monodentate tetrahedral complexes with shorter Zn–O bond distances (RZn-O = 1.94 {\AA}). Despite different coordination numbers, the measured equilibrium isotope fractionation factors for inner-sphere octahedral and tetrahedral complexes versus dissolved Zn, under the same conditions and on the same silica substrate, are not distinguishable beyond uncertainties. However, there is a larger measured equilibrium isotope fractionation with preferential sorption of heavy Zn as inner-sphere complexes on SiO2(am) ($\Delta$66/64Znaqueous-sorbed = −0.94 ± 0.11‰) than on quartz ($\Delta$66/64Znaqueous-sorbed = −0.60 ± 0.11‰).The propensity for Zn(II) to occur in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination with oxygen may help explain these observations. We posit that the low energetic difference between octahedral and tetrahedral Zn(II) may be why changes in inner-sphere Zn(II) coordination numbers with increasing coverage do not manifest as distinguishable isotope fractionations or as an observable alteration to the macroscopic sorption edges. Thus, we attribute the larger magnitude of Zn isotope fractionation on SiO2(am) compared to quartz to differences in the bonding environments on the two types of silica surfaces rather than to a change in the coordination number of Zn(II).},

abstract = {Accurate models for the incision of the Grand Canyon must include characterization of tectonic influences on incision dynamics such as active faulting and mantle to surface fluid interconnections. These young tectonic features support other geologic data that indicate that the Grand Canyon has been carved in the past 6 Ma. New U-Pb dates on speleothems are reinterpreted here in terms of improved geologic constraints and understanding of the modern aquifer. The combined data suggest that Grand Canyon incision rates have been relatively steady since 3-4 Ma. Differences in rates in the eastern (175-250 m/Ma) and western (50-80 m/Ma) Grand Canyon are explained by Neogene fault block uplift across the Toroweap-Hurricane system. Mantle tomography shows an abrupt step in mantle velocities near the Colorado Plateau edge, and geodynamic modeling suggests that upwelling asthenosphere is driving uplift of the Colorado Plateau margin relative to the Basin and Range. Our model for dynamic surface uplift in the past 6 Ma contrasts with the notion of passive incision of the Grand Canyon due solely to river integration and geomorphic response to base-level fall. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Geological Society of America.},

The new sequential extraction method fractionates elements in more detail as F1 (water soluble and exchangeable fraction), F2 (bound to carbonates), F3 (bound to manganese oxides), F4 (bound to amorphous Fe minerals), F5 (bound to crystalline Fe minerals), F6 (oxidizable fraction—bound to organic matter and sulfides) and F7 (residual). The concentrations of the elements in these fractions from the new sequential extraction method were compared with the concentrations of the elements in the fractions obtained from the BCR sequential extraction method. A MANOVA test was used to find any inter-relationships between the fractions of these sequential extraction methods. It was concluded that the percentages of the elements extracted using the new sequential extraction method for the fractions F1 to F6 were generally higher than BCR sequential extraction method. This difference was probably related to the detailed fractionation capacity of the new sequential extraction method.},

abstract = {The quantitative estimation of paleoaltitude has become an increasing focus of Earth scientists because surface elevation provides constraints on the geodynamic mechanisms operating in mountain belts, as well as the influence of mountain belt growth on regional and global climate. The general observation of decreasing $\delta$18O and $\delta$ 2H values in rainfall as elevation increases has been used in both empirical and theoretical approaches to estimate paleoelevation. These studies rely on the preservation of ancient surface water compositions in authigenic minerals to reconstruct the elevation at the time the minerals were forming. In this review we provide a theory behind the application of stable isotope-based approaches to paleoaltimetry. We apply this theory to test cases using modern precipitation and surface water isotopic compositions to demonstrate that it generally accords well with observations. Examples of the application of paleoaltimetry techniques to Himalaya-Tibet and the Andes are discussed with implications for processes that cause surface uplift.

In addition to stream type, the effect of sediment quantity variation (sediment to water ratio) was also studied. From the water quality parameters tested (electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrogen species and phosphate), only electrical conductivity showed a significant difference between the two stream types irrespective of sediment to water ratio. However, the temporal water quality of a given stream type changed with sediment quantity in the mesocosm. Re-flooding of mesocosms after complete drying did not result in blackwater conditions, but a similar spike in nutrient concentration was observed in both stream types. The absence of blackwater was attributed to the lack of addition of new organic matter and litter, as well as the saturation of dissolved oxygen in mesocosms, therefore, indicating that aeration and litter control could be used as mitigation methods for blackwater events. It was evident that water quality variations in ephemeral streams are purely based on the flow regime (hydrological flow conditions) and organic loading. No evidence was found for any unique biological and physical properties of ephemeral sediment that redeem water quality.

abstract = {Riparian soils are periodically flooded, leading to temporarily reducing conditions. Diffusion of O2 through plants into the rhizosphere maintains oxic conditions around roots, thereby promoting trace element fractionation along a redox gradient from the reduced soil matrix towards the oxic rhizosphere. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and speciation of arsenic around plant roots in a contaminated (170-280 mg/kg As) riparian floodplain soil (gleyic Fluvisol). The analysis of soil thin sections by synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence ($\mu$-XRF) spectrometry showed that As and Fe were enriched around roots and that As was closely correlated with Fe. Arsenic contents of three manually separated rhizosphere soil samples from the subsoil were 5-9 times higher than respective bulk As contents. This corresponds to the accumulation of about half of the total As in the subsoil in Fe-enrichments around roots. The speciation of As in the soil was assessed by oxalate extractions at pH 3.0 as well as by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. More than 77{\%} of the total As was oxalate extractable in all samples. XANES and EXAFS spectra demonstrated that As was predominantly As(V). For the accurate analysis of the EXAFS data with respect to the bonding of As(V) to the Fe- or Al-octahedra of (hydr)oxides and clays, all 3-leg and 4-leg multiple scattering paths within the As(V)O4-tetrahedron were considered in a fully constrained fitting scheme. We found that As(V) was predominantly associated with Fe-(hydr)oxides, and that sorption to Al- and Mn-hydroxides was negligible. The accumulation of As in the rhizosphere may affect As uptake by plants. Regarding the mobility of As, our results suggest that by oxygenation of the rhizosphere, plants attenuate the leaching of As from riparian floodplain soils during periods of high groundwater levels or flooding. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For decades, methods for leaching scheelite based on the generation of soluble phosphotungstic heteropoly acids have been continuously studied. These methods can be performed under normal pressure and can achieve a high leaching ratio when treating scheelite, but their most obvious disadvantage is that the leaching speed is very slow when treating wolframite, which has limited their application in the leaching of wolframite-containing ores. Considering the difference between the crystal forms of these two minerals, the relationship between the crystal structure of MeWO4-type tungstate and the leaching rate in acid solution containing phosphoric acid was systematically studied. The results showed that the leaching rates of all tetragonal tungstates were significantly higher than those of monoclinic and triclinic tungstates. Even in H3PO4-H2SO4 solution, sulfate precipitates were produced when leaching tetragonal tungstates, but their leaching rates were still significantly higher than those of other crystalline tungstates. In addition, the tungsten leaching rate was roughly proportional to the volume occupied by the MeWO4 unit, and NiWO4, with the closest-packed atomic arrangement, had the lowest leaching rate. It was found that the evolution of the tungstate crystal structure parameters was gradual and regular with the gradual change in the CX (cилoвыe xapaктepиcтики, obtained by the ratio of a cation's n-th ionization potential to its orbital radius), although these divalent cations are in different regions of the periodic table. Furthermore, leaching in the acid solution containing phosphoric acid yielded a better relationship between the change in the tungsten leaching rate and the change in the cation's CX in the same group or period of the periodic table.},

This overview examines some aspects of the behavior of tungsten in soil, such as the importance of characteristics of soils in relation to bioavailability processes, the chemical approaches to evaluate tungsten mobility in the soil environment and the importance of adsorption and desorption processes. Tungsten behavior depends on soil properties of which the most important is soil pH, which determines the solubility and polymerization of tungstate ions and the characteristics of the adsorbing soil surfaces. During the adsorption and desorption of tungsten, iron, and aluminum oxides, and hydroxides play a key role as they are the most important adsorbing surfaces for tungsten. The behavior of tungsten compounds in the soil determines the transfer of this element in plants and therefore in the food chain. Despite the growing importance of tungsten in everyday life, environmental regulations concerning soil do not take this element into consideration. The purpose of this review is also to provide some basic information that could be useful when considering tungsten in environmental legislation.},

abstract = {Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (EFTEM/EELS), as well as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), have been used to study bed sediments from two acid mine drainage (AMD) sites in western Montana, USA. TEM and associated techniques, including sample preparation via epoxy impregnation and ultramicrotome sectioning, afford the opportunity to better interpret and understand complex water-rock interactions in these types of samples. For the sample taken from the first site (Mike Horse mine), ferrihydrite is the dominant phase, Si and Zn are the most abundant elements sorbed to ferrihydrite surfaces, and Pb is notably absent from ferrihydrite association. Three additional important metal-containing phases (gahnite, hydrohetaerolite, and plumbojarosite), that were not apparent in the powder XRD pattern because of their relatively low concentration, were identified in the TEM. The presence of these phases is important, because, for example, gahnite and plumbojarosite act as sinks for Zn and Pb, respectively. Therefore, the mobility of Pb from this part of the drainage system depends on the stability of plumbojarosite and the ability of ferrihydrite to sorb the released Pb. From thermodynamic data in the literature, we predict that Pb will be released by the dissolution of plumbojarosite above a pH of 4 to 5, but it will then be recaptured by ferrihydrite if the pH continues to rise to 5.5 and higher, irrespective of competition effects from other metals. Therefore, only a relatively narrow pH window exists in which Pb can escape this portion of the system as an aqueous species. For the sample taken from the other site included in this study (the Carbonate mine), jarosite and quartz are the dominant phases. Interestingly, however, the jarosites are both Pb-poor and Pb-enriched. In addition, TEM reveals the presence of microcrystalline hematite with Si, S, and P sorbed to its surfaces, a nearly pure amorphous Si, Al oxyhydroxide, and an amorphous silica phase containing minor amounts of Al, Ca, and Fe. Pb will probably be released from these mixed K-Pb jarosites above pH 4 to 5, but the Pb may be retarded by the strongly adsorbing microcrystalline hematite in this pH range. The sink for Al in this system is the amorphous Si, Al oxyhydroxide, not Al(OH)3 which is typically used in AMD modeling schemes.},

abstract = {Sequential extractions are widely used for exploration purposes and to study element speciation in systems such as soil and sediments, and more recently to understand the complex biogeochemical element cycling in mine waste environments. This method is however often the focus of criticism due to uncertainty in the selectivity of specific leaches utilized. In this study, a procedure is presented how sequential extractions can be adapted to specific mineralogy in order to increase the selectivity and the accuracy of geochemical data interpretation. The application of dissolution kinetic tests and the control of dissolved phases in sequential extractions by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential X-ray diffraction (DXRD) indicate which minerals are dissolved in each leach. This information is crucial for the interpretation of geochemical data obtained from sequential extractions and enables to increase the selectivity of the sequence applied. A seven-step sequence was adapted to the specific secondary and primary mineralogy of mine tailings from Cu-sulfide ores, both from porphyry copper and from Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits. As result of the study, the following seven-step sequence shows best selectivity for the aim of the study of Cu-sulfide mine waste: Step 1 liberates the water-soluble fraction (1.0-g sample into 50-ml deionized H2O shake for 1 h at room temperature [RT]) dissolving gypsum and metal salts (e.g., chalcanthite (CuSO4{\textperiodcentered}5H2O), pickeringite (MgAl2(SO4)4{\textperiodcentered}22H2O)). Step 2 liberates the exchangeable fraction (1 M NH4-acetate, pH 4.5, shaken for 2 h, RT) as adsorbed ions, but also dissolves calcite and breaks down a typical secondary vermiculite-type mixed-layer mineral from the low pH oxidation zone. Step 3 addresses the Fe(III) oxyhydroxides fraction (0.2 M NH4-oxalate, pH 3.0, shaken for 1 h in darkness, RT) and dissolves schwertmannite, two-line ferrihydrite, Mn-hydroxides, secondary jarosite partially, as well as goethite acid mine drainage formed. Step 4 dissolves the Fe(III) oxides fraction (0.2 M NH4-oxalate, pH 3.0, heat in water bath 80 °C for 2 h) and removes all secondary ferric minerals occurring as higher ordered ferrihydrite (e.g., six-line), goethite, primary and secondary jarosite, natrojarosite, and primary hematite. Step 5 consists of a change from reducing to oxidizing condition and is performed by a H2O2 leach (35{\%} H2O2 heat in water bath for 1 h), which dissolves organic matter and supergene Cu-sulfides such as covellite and chalcocite-digenite. Step 6 (KClO3 and HCl, followed by 4 M HNO3 boiling) dissolves primary sulfides and Step 7 (HCl, HF, HClO4, HNO3) the residual fraction (silicates). The application of this extraction sequence to 5 Cu-sulfide mine tailings have shown that sequential extractions can be a powerful tool for detection of element mobilization and retention processes. This is especially the case in dry climates, where it is difficult to obtain pore-water geochemistry. A detailed mineralogical study should however go hand in hand with every geochemical study of mine waste to ensure the accuracy of the geochemical interpretations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This study aimed at elucidating the fractionation of Cd, Zn and Pb in mine tailings and evaluating the extraction selectivity of different extractants - and thus the efficiency of two sequential extraction procedures. For the purpose of figuring out the applicability of different sequential extraction procedures (SEP's) in Cd, Zn and Pb fractionation in mine tailings, two SEP's (i) modified BCR and (ii) Tessier's scheme were applied to mine tailings (new as well as old). To compare the results obtained by two methods having different number of fractions (four and five respectively), the fractions were rearranged into four "equivalent fractions" defined as acid soluble, reducible, oxidisable and residual. Systematic variations in the "reducible" fraction, i.e. the content of metal in the reducible fractions obtained by Tessier's procedure were, in general, higher than those obtained by BCR scheme. This may be attributed to stronger conditions used in Tessier's scheme to extract this fraction. This shows that the fractions are only empirically (operationally) defined and are not totally exclusive to the specified mineral phase. Percentages of Cd, Zn and Pb extracted in the organic fraction by modified BCR scheme were always higher than those obtained by Tessier's scheme. Based on the fractionation results by both the schemes, it appears that as compared to Cd and Zn, Pb has lower extraction yield in old tailings as compared to new tailings in organic/sulphides bound fraction. This can be explained by the formation of secondary Pb minerals of low solubility, formed by the oxidation of sulphides in old tailings as a result of weathering. Speciation data indicate that Cd has the greatest affinity in the acid soluble fraction, Pb is associated with the reducible fraction and Zn is incorporated into the residual fraction (crystalline silicate matrices) irrespective of the solid matrix type. The metal associations in the oxidizable fraction appear to be matrix specific, i.e., Zn dominates this fraction in new tailings and Pb in old tailings. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Few studies have addressed the mobility of tungsten in mine waste, which could act as a point source for metal leaching. This study addresses the behaviour of tungsten in tailings at the Cantung Mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada. In addition to this study, this thesis includes a literature review regarding the environmental geochemistry of tungsten. In the Cantung tailings, tungsten is present as scheelite (CaWO4; 0.1 – 0.7 wt.{\%}), copper is hosted in chalcopyrite (CuFeS2; 0.1 – 1.5 wt.{\%}), and gangue mineralogy consists of abundant pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS; 0.2 – 49 wt.{\%}), calc-silicate minerals (26 – 62 wt.{\%}), and carbonate minerals (0 – 30 wt.{\%}). In July 2018, nine surface water samples, five tailings pore-water samples, and thirteen tailings samples were collected from the Cantung Mine's tailings. Water samples have been analyzed by high resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS), yielding tungsten concentrations ranging from 5.3 to 26.3 $\mu$g/L, exclusively in samples with pH values between 7.05 – 8.05. Tungsten and iron concentrations are both on average 1.6 x higher in unfiltered aliquots compared to filtered aliquots, suggesting that tungsten is transported as dissolved species but is also adsorbed to suspended Feoxyhydroxide minerals. Tailings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) paired with automated mineralogy software (MLA), synchrotron-based $\mu$XRD-XRF, and partial leach extractions. The scheelite content of Tailings Pond 3 (TP3) and the FRT are similar (0.15 wt.{\%} and 0.21 wt.{\%}, respectively), and scheelite shows no evidence of alteration. Synchrotron-based $\mu$XRD of Feoxyhydroxide minerals in the FRT identify goethite (FeOOH) and lepidocrocite ($\gamma$-FeOOH), whereas $\mu$XRD spectra of pyrrhotite rims from TP3 do not match Fe-minerals, with the exception of rare rims that match hematite (Fe2O3) and maghemite ($\gamma$-Fe2O3). The $\mu$XRF maps of the hematite-maghemite rims have prominent tungsten peaks, which represents included scheelite grains and possibly structurally incorporated tungsten, likely formed during ore processing. The hydroxylamine leaches yield higher tungsten concentrations in tailings samples from the impoundments than samples from the FRT, suggesting the tailings impoundments have more tungsten that is associated with poorly crystalline an amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxide phases than the FRT. Over time, labile-hosted tungsten in the FRT may have been washed down the Flat River during Fe-oxyhydroxide recrystallization and high energy flooding events.},

abstract = {Zn isotopic fractionation caused by sorption on 2-Lines ferrihydrite (Fh2L) and goethite was investigated to assess the role of reactions at the Fe-oxyhydroxide/water interface in changes of the isotopic distribution of Zn. Since sorption reactions are ubiquitous in Earth's surface environments, it is important to evaluate their influence on the isotopic distribution of Zn before it can be used to track and quantify contributions of various sources and/or biogeochemical processes involving this element. Our results show that Zn isotopes are fractionated upon sorption on Fe-oxyhydroxides with an enrichment of the heavy isotopes present on the solid's surface. This fractionation appears to proceed through an equilibrium mechanism and yields different ($\Delta$66/64Zn)sorbed-aqueous values for Zn sorption on goethite [($\Delta$66/64Zn)sorbed-aqueous around +0.29‰] and Fh2L [($\Delta$66/64Zn)sorbed-aqueous around +0.53‰]. These different magnitudes of Zn fractionation are related to structural differences between Zn complexes existing on the surface of goethite (octahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen atoms) and Fh2L (tetrahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen atoms), as evidenced by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and CD-MUSIC modeling. These results show the importance of accounting for reactions at the Fe-oxyhydroxide/water interface when dealing with the isotopic distribution of Zn at the Earth's surface. Considering the large range of other possible sorbents (Mn or Al oxides, phyllosilicates, carbonates, biologic surfaces, etc.) and the importance of reactions at sorbent/water interfaces for other non-traditional stable isotopes (i.e. Cr, Fe, Ni and Cu) that are increasingly used in environmental studies, these results emphasize the need for further experimental studies that are needed to quantify the isotopic fractionation of these elements possibly accompanying their sorption. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A clearer understanding of arsenic (As) retention and transport in forest soils impacted by copper smelter emissions may reduce risks to human health and provide insight into As behavior in the vadose zone. On Vashon-Maury Island in Puget Sound, As is predominantly associated with the fine ({\textless}63 $\mu$m) fraction of surficial soils. X-ray diffraction of oriented samples from the {\textless}2-$\mu$m size fraction indicate that clinochlore is the dominant phyllosilicate. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to examine As oxidation state and local coordination environment in impacted soil samples. Arsenic is present as As(V) in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, associated with aluminum (Al) octahedra in bidentate binuclear (bridging) structures with As-Al distances of 3.15-3.16 {\AA}. Including multiple scattering (MS) paths derived from the arsenate tetrahedron in esperanzaite significantly improved the match between XAS fine structure (EXAFS) data and models generated from theoretical phase and amplitude functions. The data are interpreted to indicate arsenate adsorption onto poorly crystalline aluminum oxyhydroxides and/or the edges of clinochlore interlayer hydroxyl sheets with constrained geometries causing MS to be important. This implies that As initially released from the smelter as particulate As(III) and As(V) oxides was oxidized, dissolved, and adsorbed onto soil minerals and colloids; no evidence for relic arsenic oxide was observed. Physical transport of arsenic oxide particles and As adsorbed on soil colloids may account for limited downward migration of As within the soil column. The oxidizing and mildly acidic pH conditions in the upper vadose zone promote stable sorption complexes; barring substantial changes in soil chemistry. As is not expected to experience significant mobilization. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {An aquifer where receives steady lateral recharge from an AMD-polluted river, was chosen to understand the profound influence of the “solid-liquid phase” evolution on the mobility of trace metals. The results showed that the accumulation of trace metals in groundwater was observed near the riparian zone. Zn and Cd almost remained in the “truly dissolved” phase ({\textless}3 kDa), whereas Cu and Pb were mainly in the coarse colloid (0.22 $\mu$m–30 kDa) and shifted from the coarse colloid to the “truly dissolved” phase along the flow path. The evolution of relatively high dispersive colloids to low dispersive colloids indicated that the Al-rich mineral colloids as the dominance migrated with the groundwater flow path, and flocculated gradually so that the porous matrix was coated by gibbsite. The coating of gibbsite dissociates OH− in acidic environment, resulting in the decreasing negative charge in porous matrix. Thus, the mobility of Cu and Pb was shifted from the colloid-facilitated transport to the co-precipitation with colloids, whereas the mobility of Zn and Cd was changed from the high electrostatic binding to the low electrostatic binding. Numerical simulation also confirmed the varying retardation factor and the total penetration time followed an order of Pb {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Cd. Therefore, the changes in “two phases” in the aquifer—not only in water phase but also in colloid phase and porous matrix—have a profound influence on metal migration that take place in shallow groundwater where there are close hydraulic connection between river and groundwater.},

abstract = {Prior to remediation at the abandoned Cu-Zn Penn Mine in the Foothills massive sulfide belt of the Sierra Nevada, CA, acid mine drainage (AMD) was created, in part, by the subaerial oxidation of sulfides exposed on several waste piles. To support remediation efforts, a mineralogical study of the waste piles was undertaken by acquiring reflectance spectra (measured in the visible to short-wave infrared range of light (0.35-2.5 $\mu$m) using a portable, digitally integrated pen tablet PC mapping system with differential global positioning system and laser rangefinder support. Analysis of the spectral data made use of a continuum removal and band-shape comparison method, and of reference spectral libraries of end-member minerals and mineral mixtures. Identification of secondary Fe-bearing minerals focused on band matching in the region between 0.43 and 1.3 $\mu$m. Identification of sheet and other silicates was based on band-shape analysis in the region between 1.9 and 2.4 $\mu$m. Analysis of reflectance spectra of characterized rock samples from the mine helped in gauging the spectral response to particle size and mixtures. The resulting mineral maps delineated a pattern of accumulation of secondary Fe minerals, wherein centers of copiapite and jarosite that formed at low pH ({\textless}3) were surrounded successively by goethite and hematite, which mark progressive increases in pH. This pattern represents the evolution of acid solutions discharged from the pyritic waste piles and the subsequent accumulation of secondary precipitates by hydrolysis reactions. The results highlight the high capacity of the pyritic waste to release further acid mine drainage into the environment, as well as the effectiveness of the mapping method to detect subtle changes in surface mineralogy and to produce maps useful to agencies responsible for remediating the site. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The geochemistry of tungsten has recently gained attention in the scientific and regulatory communities. Tungsten has a complex geochemistry, existing in many environmental matrices as the soluble and mobile tungstate anion, as well as a series of ill-defined polymeric species. Previous work has shown that soluble tungsten leached from a metallic tungsten-spiked Grenada Loring soil will reach an equilibrium concentration {\textgreater}150 mg L-1, and the concentration is greatly influenced by co-occurring analytes in the matrix, such as calcium and phosphate. In the present work, the mobility of tungsten compounds was investigated in a model soil with a range of aqueous leach solutions using column experiments. The relative column leachate concentrations measured followed trends from previously reported tungstate and polytungstate partition coefficients determined in the model soil under identical aqueous matrix conditions. Neutral to alkaline conditions produced maximum effluent tungsten concentrations {\textgreater}40 mg L-1, whereas acid leach eluents produced concentrations in the {\textless}1-3 mg L-1 range. The change in leached tungsten speciation over time was also measured as monomeric and polymeric tungsten species have different sorptive behaviors.},

abstract = {In order to realize resource utilization of industrial tungsten residue and treatment of heavy metal wastewater in mining and metallurgical area of south China, a novel ceramsite was prepared with the main raw materials of diatomite and tungsten residue. The adsorption behavior of copper ions in solution on the ceramsite was investigated. Results indicated that the surface of the newly-developed ceramsite was rough and porous. There were lots of pores across the ceramsite from inner to outside. MnFe2O4 was one of the main components of the ceramsite. The Cu2+ adsorption capacity by the ceramsite reached 9.421 mg/g with copper removal efficiency of 94.21{\%} at 303 K, initial Cu2+ concentration of 100 mg/L and dosage of 0.5 g after 300 min adsorption. With increase of ceramsite dosage, the total adsorption amount of Cu2+ increased, but the adsorption capacity decreased. The adsorption capacity increased with the increase of solution pH. The isothermal adsorption of Cu2+ by the ceramsite fitted the Freundlich model better. The adsorption mainly occurred on a heterogeneous surface, and was a favorable process. The adsorption process closely followed the pseudo-second kinetic equation. In initial stage of wastewater treatment, the adsorption process should be controlled mainly by diffusion, and the removal of Cu2+ can be improved by enhancing agitation.},

abstract = {The measurement of trace-element concentration in soil, sediment and waste, is generally a combination of a digestion procedure for dissolution of elements and a subsequent measurement of the dissolved elements. "Partial" and "total" digestion methods can be used in environmental monitoring activities. To compare measurement results obtained by different methods, it is crucial to determine and to maintain control of the bias of the results obtained by these methods. In this paper, ICP-MS results obtained after matrix digestion with modified aqua regia (HCl+HNO3+H2O2) method and two "total" digestion methods (microwave aqua regia+HF and HNO3+HF) are compared with those obtained by instrumental neutron activation analysis, a non-destructive analytical method for the determination of the total mass concentrations of inorganic components in environmental matrices. The comparison was carried out on eight agricultural soil samples collected in one test area and measured by k0-INAA and ICP-MS to determine As, Co, Cr, Sb and Zn mass concentration. The bias of results for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn of the three digestion methods were assessed using selected measurement standards. This paper highlights that the digestion procedure is an integral part of the measurement and can affect the measurement result in environmental analysis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The mobility and solid-state speciation of zinc in a pseudogley soil (pH = 8.2-8.3) before and after contamination by land-disposition of a dredged sediment ([Zn] = 6600 mg kg-1) affected by smelter operations were studied in a 50 m2 pilot-scale test site and the laboratory using state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques. Sediment disposition on land caused the migration of micrometer-sized, smelter-related, sphalerite (ZnS) and franklinite (ZnFe2 O4) grains and dissolved Zn from the sediment downwards to a soil depth of 20 cm over a period of 18 months. Gravitational movement of fine-grained metal contaminants probably occurred continuously, while peaks of Zn leaching were observed in the summer when the oxidative dissolution of ZnS was favored by non-flooding conditions. The Zn concentration in the {\textless}50 $\mu$m soil fraction increased from ∼61 ppm to ∼94 ppm in the first 12 months at 0-10 cm depth, and to ∼269 ppm in the first 15 months following the sediment deposition. Higher Zn concentrations and enrichments were observed in the fine ({\textless}2 $\mu$m) and very fine ({\textless}0.2 $\mu$m) fractions after 15 months (480 mg kg-1 and 1000 mg kg-1, respectively), compared to 200 mg kg-1 in the {\textless}2 $\mu$m fraction of the initial soil. In total, 1.2{\%} of the Zn initially present in the sediment was released to the environment after 15 months, representing an integrated quantity of ∼4 kg Zn over an area of 50 m2. Microfocused X-ray fluorescence (XRF), diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy techniques were used to image chemical associations of Zn with Fe and Mn, and to identify mineral and Zn species in selected points-of-interest in the uncontaminated and contaminated soil. Bulk average powder EXAFS spectroscopy was used to quantify the proportion of each Zn species in the soil. In the uncontaminated soil, Zn is largely speciated as Zn-containing phyllosilicate, and to a minor extent as zincochromite (ZnCr2O4), IVZn-sorbed turbostratic birnessite ($\delta$-MnO2), and Zn-substituted goethite. In the upper 0-10 cm of the contaminated soil, ∼60 ± 10{\%} of total Zn is present as ZnS inherited from the overlying sediment. Poorly-crystalline Zn-sorbed Fe (oxyhydr)oxides and zinciferous phyllosilicate amount to ∼20-30 ± 10{\%} each and, therefore, make up most of the remaining Zn. Smaller amounts of franklinite (ZnFe2O4), Zn-birnessite and Zn-goethite were also detected. Further solubilization of the Zn inventory in the sediment, and also remobilization of Zn from the poorly-crystalline neoformed Fe (oxyhydr)oxide precipitates, are expected over time. This study shows that land deposition of contaminated dredged sediments is a source of Zn for the covered soil and, consequently, presents environmental hazards. Remediation technologies should be devised to either sequester Zn into sparingly soluble crystalline phases, or remove Zn by collecting leachates beneath the sediment.

abstract = {Tungsten is a widely used transition metal for which very limited information on environmental and toxicological effects is available. Of particular interest is the lack of information linking tungsten speciation and environmental effects. Tungsten anions may polymerize (depending upon concentration, pH, and aquatic geochemistry) in aquatic and soil systems. However, to this date, of all soluble tungstate species only monotungstates have been scrutinized to a fair extent in toxicological studies. The objective of this work is a comparative assessment of the acute toxicity of monotungstates (sodium tungstate, Na2WO4) and polytungstates (sodium metatungstate, 3Na2WO4{\textperiodcentered}9WO3) to Poecilia reticulate. The experiments have been performed according to the OEDC protocols 203 and 204. LD50 values for 1-14 days show that sodium metatungstate is significantly more toxic to fish than sodium tungstate. Based on LD50 (0.86-3.88 g L-1 or 4.67-21.1×10-3 mol Na2WO4 L-1), sodium tungstate may be classified as a chemical of low toxicity to fish. Sodium metatungstate caused similar fish mortality to sodium tungstate when it was introduced in 55-80 times lower concentrations (in terms of mol L-1) than sodium tungstate. LD50 values for sodium metatungstate range from 0.13 to 0.85 g W L-1 or 5.69 to 38.71×10-5 mol 3Na2WO4{\textperiodcentered}9WO3 L-1. Based on these values sodium metatungstate can be classified as a moderate toxic agent to fish. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study investigates the dissolution, sorption, leachability, and plant uptake of tungsten and alloying metals from canister round munitions in the presence of model, well characterized soils. The source of tungsten was canister round munitions, composed mainly of tungsten (95{\%}) with iron and nickel making up the remaining fraction. Three soils were chosen for the lysimeter studies while four model soils were selected for the adsorption studies. Lysimeter soils were representatives of the typical range of soils across the continental USA; muck-peat, clay-loamy and sandy-quartzose soil. Adsorption equilibrium data on the four model soils were modeled with Langmuir and linear isotherms and the model parameters were obtained. The adsorption affinity of soils for tungsten follows the order: Pahokee peat{\textgreater}kaolinite{\textgreater}montmorillonite{\textgreater}illite. A canister round munition dissolution study was also performed. After 24d, the measured dissolved concentrations were: 61.97, 3.56, 15.83mgL-1 for tungsten, iron and nickel, respectively. Lysimeter transport studies show muck peat and sandy quartzose soils having higher tungsten concentration, up to 150mgkg-1 in the upper layers of the lysimeters and a sharp decline with depth suggesting strong retardation processes along the soil profile. The concentrations of tungsten, iron and nickel in soil lysimeter effluents were very low in terms of posing any environmental concern; although no regulatory limits have been established for tungsten in natural waters. The substantial uptake of tungsten and nickel by ryegrass after 120d of exposure to soils containing canister round munition suggests the possibility of tungsten and nickel entering the food chain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study of tungsten in the environment is currently of considerable interest because of the growing concerns resulting from its possible toxicity and carcinogenicity. Adsorption reactions are some of the fundamental processes governing the fate and transport of tungsten compounds in soil. This paper reports data on the adsorption of tungstate ions in three different Italian soils, which are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. The results show that pH is the most important factor governing the adsorption of tungstate in these soils. The data interpreted according to the Langmuir equation show that the maximum value of adsorption is approximately 30 mmol kg−1 for the most acidic soil (pH = 4.50) and approximately 9 mmol kg−1 for the most basic soil (pH = 7.40). In addition, soil organic matter is shown to play a fundamental role in adsorption processes, which are favored in soils with a higher organic matter content. The data could contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of tungsten compounds in Italian soils for which current knowledge is very scarce, also in view of environmental regulations, which are currently lacking.},

abstract = {High levels of total and bioavailable As in soils in mining areas may lead to the potential contamination of surface water and groundwater, being toxic to human, plants, and animals. The soils in the studied area (Province of Salamanca, Spain) recorded a total As concentration that varied from 5.5. mg/kg to 150. mg/kg, and water-soluble As ranged from 0.004. mg/kg to 0.107. mg/kg, often exceeding the guideline limits for agricultural soil (50. mg/kg total As, 0.04. mg/kg water-soluble As). The range of As concentration in pond water was {\textless}0.001$\mu$g/l-60$\mu$g/l, with 40{\%} of samples exceeding the maximum permissible level (10$\mu$g/l) for drinking water. Estimated bioavailable As in soil varied from 0.045. mg/kg to 0.760. mg/kg, around six times higher than water-soluble As fraction, which may pose a high potential risk in regard to its entry into food chain. Soil column leaching tests show an As potential mobility constant threatening water contamination by continuous leaching. The vertical distribution of As through soil profiles suggests a deposition mechanism of this element on the top-soils that involves the wind or water transport of mine tailings. A similar vertical distribution of As and organic matter (OM) contents in soil profiles, as well as, significant correlations between As concentrations and OM and N contents, suggests that type and content of soil OM are major factors for determining the content, distribution, and mobilization of As in the soil. Due to the low supergenic mobility of this element in mining environments, the soil pollution degree in the studied area is moderate, in spite of the elevated As contents in mine tailings. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {While many workers have utilized various reagents for sequential extraction of soil trace metals, few studies have examined the order of extraction for key steps in the sequential procedure. In this study, several sequences involving both adsorbed and structural (occluded) metal extractants were evaluated to determine the most appropriate sequential methodology for extracting different forms of Cu, Fe, and Mn. For "specifically adsorbed" metals, Pb(N03)2 and CH3COOH were used. The results showed that the former reagent extracted less Cu, Mn, and Fe and was probably more specific in replacing metals covalently bound to adsorption sites. Lead nitrate was therefore placed before CH3COOH extraction in the sequence. Chao's NH20H.HCI reagent and K.P20" used for Mn oxide and organic metal removal, respectively, were found to solubilize significantly different amounts of Cu and Mn depending on sequence, with K.P20, extracting more metal when used first. As NH20H. HCI has little effect on organic metals, it should be used before K.P20,. Noncrystalline and crystalline Fe compounds are solubilized next, using a variety of reagents, and residual (silicate lattice) metals are dissolved in the final step. A nine-step sequential method is proposed to characterize trace metals in agricultural, polluted, and wasteamended soils.},

New paleosol carbonate stable isotope ($\delta$18O) results from central Oregon are presented, along with published proxy data, including fossil teeth, smectites, and carbonate concretions. We interpret a polygenetic history of Cascade Mountain topographic uplift along-strike, characterized by: 1) Steady uplift of the Washington Cascades through the Cenozoic due long-term arc rotation and shortening against a Canadian buttress, and 2) Uplift of the Oregon Cascades to similar-to-modern elevations by the late Oligocene, followed by topographic stagnation as extension developed into the Neogene. Since the Miocene, meteoric water $\delta$18O values have decreased in Oregon, possibly due to emergence of the Coast Range and westward migration of the coastline. Spatial variability in isotopic change throughout the Pacific Northwest suggests that secular global climate change is not the primary forcing mechanism behind isotopic trends, though Milankovitch cycles may be partly responsible for relatively short-term variation.},

@article{Seiler2005,
abstract = {An investigation of a childhood leukemia cluster by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that residents of the Carson Desert, Nevada, are exposed to high levels of W and this prompted an investigation of W in aquifers used as drinking water sources. Tungsten concentrations in 100 ground water samples from all aquifers used as drinking water sources in the area ranged from 0.27 to 742 $\mu$g/l. Ground water in which W concentrations exceed 50 $\mu$g/l principally occurs SE of Fallon in a geothermal area. The principal sources of W in ground water are natural and include erosion of W-bearing mineral deposits in the Carson River watershed upstream of Fallon, and, possibly, upwelling geothermal waters. Ground water in the Fallon area is strongly reducing and reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides may be releasing W; however, direct evidence that the metal oxides contain W is not available. Although W and Cl concentrations in the Carson River, a lake, and water from many wells, appear to be controlled by evaporative concentration, evaporation alone cannot explain the elevated W concentrations found in water from some of the wells. Concentrations of W exceeding 50 $\mu$g/l are exclusively associated with Na-HCO3 and Na-Cl water types and pH {\textgreater} 8.0; in these waters, geochemical modeling indicates that W exhibits {\textless}10{\%} adsorption. Tungsten concentrations are strongly and positively correlated with As, B, F, and P, indicating either common sources or common processes controlling their concentrations. Geochemical modeling indicates W concentrations are consistent with pH-controlled adsorption of W. The geochemical model PHREEQC was used to calculate IAP values, which were compared with published Ksp values for primary W minerals. FeWO4, MnWO4, Na2WO4, and MgWO4 were undersaturated and CaWO4 and SrWO 4 were approaching saturation. These conclusions are tentative because of uncertainty in the thermodynamic data. The similar behavior of As and W observed in this study suggests ground water in areas where elevated As concentrations are present also may contain elevated W concentrations, particularly if there is a mineral or geothermal source of W and reducing conditions develop in the aquifer.},

abstract = {Sulphidic mine tailings are among the largest mining wastes on Earth and are prone to produce acid mine drainage (AMD). The formation of AMD is a sequence of complex biogeochemical and mineral dissolution processes. It can be classified in three main steps occurring from the operational phase of a tailings impoundment until the final appearance of AMD after operations ceased: (1) During the operational phase of a tailings impoundment the pH-Eh regime is normally alkaline to neutral and reducing (water-saturated). Associated environmental problems include the presence of high sulphate concentrations due to dissolution of gypsum-anhydrite, and/or effluents enriched in elements such as Mo and As, which desorbed from primary ferric hydroxides during the alkaline flotation process. (2) Once mining-related operations of the tailings impoundment has ceased, sulphide oxidation starts, resulting in the formation of an acidic oxidation zone and a ferrous iron-rich plume below the oxidation front, that re-oxidises once it surfaces, producing the first visible sign of AMD, i.e., the precipitation of ferrihydrite and concomitant acidification. (3) Consumption of the (reactive) neutralization potential of the gangue minerals and subsequent outflow of acidic, heavy metal-rich leachates from the tailings is the final step in the evolution of an AMD system. The formation of multi-colour efflorescent salts can be a visible sign of this stage.},
